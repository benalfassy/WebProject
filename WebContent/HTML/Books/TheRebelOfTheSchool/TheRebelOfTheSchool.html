				<h3>SENT TO COVENTRY!</h3>


				<p>The school was situated in the suburbs of the popular town of
					Merrifield, and was known as the Great Shirley School. It had been
					endowed some hundred years ago by a rich and eccentric individual
					who bore the name of Charles Shirley, but was now managed by a
					Board of Governors. By the express order of the founder, the
					governors were women; and very admirably did they fulfil their
					trust. There was no recent improvement in education, no better
					methods, no sanitary requirements which were not introduced into
					the Great Shirley School. The number of pupils was limited to four
					hundred, one hundred of which were foundationers and were not
					required to pay any fees; the remaining three hundred paid small
					fees in order to be allowed to secure an admirable and up-to-date
					education under the auspices of the great school.</p>

				<p>There came a day in early autumn, shortly after the girls had
					reassembled after their summer vacation, when they streamed out of
					the building in groups of twenties and thirties and forties. They
					stood about and talked as girls will.</p>

				<p>
					<!-- Page 6 -->
					<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>The Great Shirley School, well as
					it was managed, had perhaps a larger share than many schools of
					those temptations which make school a world—a world for the
					training either for good or evil of those who go to it. There were
					the girls who attended the school in the ordinary way, and there
					were the girls who were drafted on to the foundation from lower
					schools. These latter were looked down upon by the least noble and
					the meanest of their fellow-scholars.
				</p>

				<p>There was a slight rain falling, and two or three girls
					standing in a group raised their umbrellas, but they still stood
					beside the gates.</p>

				<p>"She's quite the very prettiest girl I ever saw," cried Alice
					Tennant; "but of course we can have nothing to do with her. She
					entered a week ago. She doesn't pay any of the fees; she has no
					pretence to being a lady. Oh, here she comes! Did you ever see such
					a face?"</p>

				<p>A slight, shabbily dressed little girl, with her satchel of
					books slung on her arm, now appeared. She looked to right and left
					of her as though she were slightly alarmed. Her face was beautiful
					in the truest sense of the world; it did not at all match with the
					shabby, faded clothes which she wore. She had large deep-violet
					eyes, jet-black hair, and a sweet, fresh complexion. Her expression
					was bewitching, and when she smiled a dimple came in her cheek.</p>

				<p>"Look—look!" cried Mary Denny. "Isn't she all that I have
					said?"</p>

				<p>"Yes, and more. What a pity we can't know her!" said Alice
					Tennant.</p>

				<p>"But can't we? I really don't see why we should make the poor
					child miserable," said Mary Denny.</p>

				<p>
					"It is not to be thought of. We must worship the
					<!-- Page 7 -->
					<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a> beautiful new star from afar.
					Perhaps she will do something to raise herself into our set; but as
					it is, she must go with Kate Rourke and Hannah Johnson and Clara
					Sawyer, and all the rest of the foundationers."
				</p>

				<p>"Well, we have seen her now," said Mary, "so I suppose we
					needn't stand talking about her any longer. Will you come home and
					have tea with me, Alice? Mother said I might ask you."</p>

				<p>"I wish I could come," said Alice; "but we are expecting
					Kathleen."</p>

				<p>"Oh, the Irish girl! Is it really arranged that she is to
					come?"</p>

				<p>"Yes, of course it is. She comes to-night. I have never seen
					her. We are all pleased, and expect that she will be a very great
					acquisition."</p>

				<p>"Irish girls always are," said Mary. "They're so gay and full
					of life, and are so ridiculously witty. Don't you remember that
					time when we had Norah Mahoney at the school? What fun that was!"</p>

				<p>"But she got into terrible scrapes, and was practically
					dismissed," said Alice. "I only hope Kathleen won't be in that
					style."</p>

				<p>"But do you know anything about her? The Irish are always so
					terribly poor."</p>

				<p>"She is not poor at all. She has got an uncle and aunt in
					Chicago, and they are as rich as can be; and her uncle is coming to
					see her at Christmas. And besides that, her father has an awfully
					old castle in the south-west of Ireland. He is never troubled on
					account of the Land League or anything else, and Kathleen will have
					lots and lots of money. I know she is paying mother well for giving
					her a home while she is being educated at the Shirley School."</p>

				<p>
					"I can't imagine why she comes to our school if she is
					<!-- Page 8 -->
					<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a> so rich," said Mary. "It seems
					almost unfair. The Great Shirley School is not meant for rich
					girls: a girl of the kind you have just described ought not to
					become a member of the school."
				</p>

				<p>"Oh, that is all very fine; but it seems her mother was
					educated here, and swore a sort of vow that when Kathleen was old
					enough she should come to this school and to no other. Her mother's
					name is Mrs. O'Hara, and she wrote to Miss Ravenscroft and asked if
					there was a vacancy for Kathleen, and if she knew of any one who
					would be nice to her and with whom she could live. Miss Ravenscroft
					thought of mother; she knew that mother would like to have a
					boarder who would pay her well. So the whole thing was settled;
					mother has been corresponding with Mrs. O'Hara, and Kathleen comes
					to-day. I really can't stay another moment, Mary. I must rush home;
					there are no end of things to be attended to."</p>

				<p>"All right," said Mary. "I will watch for you and the
					beautiful Irish heiress—"</p>

				<p>"I don't know that she is an heiress."</p>

				<p>"Well, whatever she is—the bewitching Irish girl—to-morrow
					morning. Ta-ta for the present."</p>

				<p>Mary turned to the left, and Alice continued her walk. She
					walked quickly. She was a well-made, rather pretty girl of fifteen.
					Her hair, very light in colour, hung down her back. She had a
					determined walk and a good carriage. As she hurried her steps she
					saw Ruth Craven, the pretty foundation girl, walking in front of
					her. Ruth walked slowly and as if she were tired. Once she pressed
					her hand to her side, and Alice, passing her, hesitated and looked
					back. The face that met hers was so appealing and loving that she
					could not resist saying a word.</p>

				<p>"Are you awfully tired, Ruth Craven?" she said.</p>

				<p>
					<!-- Page 9 -->
					<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>"I shall get used to it," replied
					Ruth. "I have had a cold for the last few days. Thank you so much,
					Miss Tennant!"
				</p>

				<p>"Don't thank me," said Alice, frowning; "and don't say 'Miss
					Tennant,' It isn't good form in our school. I hope you will be
					better to-morrow. I am sure, at least, that you will like the
					school very much."</p>

				<p>"Thank you," said the girl again.</p>

				<p>The girls parted at the next corner. When Ruth found herself
					alone she paused and looked behind her. Tears rose to her eyes; she
					took out her handkerchief to wipe them away. She paused as if
					troubled by some thought; then her face grew bright, and she
					stepped along more briskly.</p>

				<p>"I am a coward, and I ought to be ashamed of myself," she
					thought. "Now, when I go in and grandfather sees me, he will think
					he has done quite wrong to let me go to the Shirley School. I must
					not let him think that. And granny will be still more vexed. I have
					had my heart's desire, and because things are not quite so pleasant
					as I hoped they would have been, it is no reason why I should be
					discontented."</p>

				<p>The next moment she had lifted the latch at a small cottage
					and entered. It was a little better than a workman's house, but not
					much; there were two rooms downstairs and two rooms upstairs, and
					that was all. To the front of the little house was the tiny
					parlour, at the back an equally tiny kitchen. Upstairs was a
					bedroom for Ruth and a bedroom for her grandparents. Mr. and Mrs.
					Craven did not keep any servants. The moment Ruth entered now her
					grandmother put her head out of the kitchen door.</p>

				<p>
					"Ruthie," she said, "the butcher has disappointed us to-day. Here
					is a shilling; go to the shop and bring in
					<!-- Page 10 -->
					<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a> some sausages. Be as quick as
					you can, child, or your grandfather won't have his supper in time."
				</p>

				<p>Ruth took the money without a word. She went down a small
					lane, turned to her right, and found herself in a mean little
					street full of small shops. She entered one that she knew, and
					asked for a pound and a half of pork sausages. As the woman was
					wrapping them up in a piece of torn newspaper, she looked at Ruth
					and said:</p>

				<p>"Is it true, Miss Craven, that you are a scholar at the Great
					Shirley School?"</p>

				<p>"I am," replied Ruth. "I went there for the first time
					to-day."</p>

				<p>"So your grandparents are going to educate you, miss, as if
					you were a lady."</p>

				<p>"I am a lady, Mrs. Plowden. My grandparents cannot make me
					anything but what I am."</p>

				<p>Mrs. Plowden smiled. She handed Ruth her sausages without a
					word, and the young girl left the shop. Her grandmother was waiting
					for her in the porch.</p>

				<p>"What a time you have been, child!" she said. "I do hope this
					new school and the scholars and all this fuss and excitement of
					your new life won't turn your head. Whatever happens, you have got
					to be a little servant to me and a little messenger to your
					grandfather. You have got to make yourself useful, and not to have
					ideas beyond your station."</p>

				<p>"Here are the sausages, granny," answered Ruth in a gentle
					tone.</p>

				<p>The old lady took them from her and disappeared into the
					kitchen.</p>

				<p>"Ruth—Ruth!" said a somewhat querulous but very deep voice
					which evidently issued from the parlor.</p>

				<p>
					"Yes, granddad; coming in a moment or two," Ruth

					<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a> replied. She ran up the tiny
					stairs, and entered her own little bedroom, which was so wee that
					she could scarcely turn round in it, but was extremely neat.
				</p>

				<p>Ruth removed her hat, brushed out her black hair, saw that
					her dress, shabby as it was, was in apple-pie order, put on a neat
					white apron, and ran downstairs. She first of all entered the
					parlor. A handsome old man, with a decided look of Ruth herself,
					was seated by the fire. He was holding out his thin, knuckly hands
					to the blaze. As Ruth came in he turned and smiled at her.</p>

				<p>"Ah, deary!" he said, "I have been missing you all day. And
					how did you like your school? And how is everything?"</p>

				<p>"I will tell you after supper, grandfather. I must go and
					help granny now."</p>

				<p>"That's right; that's a good girl. Oh! far be it from me to
					be impatient; I wouldn't be for all the world. Your granny has
					missed you too to-day."</p>

				<p>Ruth smiled at him and went into the kitchen. There were
					eager voices and sounds of people hurrying about, and then a
					fragrant smell of fried sausages. A moment later Ruth appeared,
					holding a brightly trimmed lamp in her hand; she laid it on a
					little centre-table, drew down the blinds, pulled the red curtains
					across the windows, poked up the fire, and then proceeded to lay
					the cloth for supper. Her pile of books, which she had brought in
					her satchel, lay on a chair.</p>

				<p>"I can have a look at your books while I am waiting, can't I,
					little woman?" said the old man.</p>

				<p>Ruth brought him over the pack of books somewhat unwillingly.
					He gave a sigh of contentment, drew the lamp a little nearer, and
					was lost for the time being.</p>

				<p>
					"Now, child," said old Mrs. Craven, "you heat that
					<!-- Page 12 -->
					<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a> plate by the fire. Have you got
					the pepper and salt handy? Sausages ain't worth touching unless you
					eat them piping hot. Your grandfather wants his beer. Dear, dear!
					What a worry that is! I never knew that the cask was empty. What is
					to be done?"
				</p>

				<p>"I can go round to the shop and bring in a quart," said Ruth.</p>

				<p>"But you—a member of the Shirley School! No, you mustn't.
					I'll do it."</p>

				<p>"Nonsense, granny! I'll leave school to-morrow if you don't
					let me work for you just the same as ever."</p>

				<p>Mrs. Craven sank into her chair.</p>

				<p>"You are a good child," she said. "All day I have been so
					fretting that we were taking you out of your station; and that is a
					sad mistake—sad and terrible. But you are a good child. Yes, go for
					it, dear; it won't do you any harm."</p>

				<p>Ruth wrapped an old shawl round her head, picked up a jug,
					and went off to the nearest public-house. They were accustomed to
					see her there, for old Mr. Craven more often than not had his
					little cask of beer empty. She went to a side entrance, where a
					woman she knew served her with what she required.</p>

				<p>"There, Ruth Craven," she said—"there it is. But, all the
					same, I'm surprised to see you here to-night."</p>

				<p>"But why so?" asked Ruth.</p>

				<p>"Isn't it true that you are one of the Shirley scholars now?"</p>

				<p>"I am; I joined the school to-day."</p>

				<p>"And yet you come to fetch beer for your old grandfather!"</p>

				<p>"I do," said Ruth, with spirit. "And I shall fetch it for him
					as long as he wants it. Thank you very much."</p>

				<p>
					<!-- Page 13 -->
					<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>She took the jug and walked
					carefully back to the cottage.
				</p>

				<p>"She's the handsomest, most spirited, best little thing I
					ever met," thought the landlady of the "Lion," and she began to
					consider in her own mind if one of her men could not call round in
					the morning and leave the necessary beer at the Cravens'.</p>

				<p>Supper was served, and was eaten with considerable relish by
					all three.</p>

				<p>"Now," said old granny when the meal had come to an end, "you
					stay and talk to your grandfather—he is all agog to hear what you
					have got to say—and I will wash up. Now then, child, don't you
					worry. It isn't everybody who has got loving grandparents like us."</p>

				<p>"And it isn't many old bodies who have got such a dear little
					granddaughter," said the old man, smiling at Ruth.</p>

				<p>Mrs. Craven carried the supper things into the kitchen, and
					Ruth sat close to her grandfather.</p>

				<p>"Now, tell me, child, tell me," he said. "What did they do?
					What class did they put you into?"</p>

				<p>"I am in the third remove; a very good class indeed—at least
					they all said so, grandfather."</p>

				<p>"I don't understand your modern names; but tell me what you
					have got to learn, dear. What sort of lessons are they going to put
					into that smart little head of yours?"</p>

				<p>"Oh, all the best things, grandfather—French, German, English
					in all its branches, music, and Latin if I like. I am determined to
					take up Latin; I want to get to the heart of things."</p>

				<p>"Quite right—quite right, too. And you are ever so pleased at
					having got in?"</p>

				<p>
					<!-- Page 14 -->
					<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>"It does seem a grand thing for
					me, doesn't it, grandfather?"
				</p>

				<p>"Most of the girls are ladies, aren't they?"</p>

				<p>"It is a big school—between three and four hundred girls. I
					don't suppose they are all ladies."</p>

				<p>"Well, you are, anyhow, my little Ruth."</p>

				<p>"Am I, granddad? That is the question."</p>

				<p>"What do you think yourself?"</p>

				<p>"I think so; but what does the world say?"</p>

				<p>"Ruth, I never told you, but your mother was a lady. You know
					what your father was. I saved and stinted and toiled and got him a
					commission in the army. He died, poor fellow, shortly after you
					were born. But he was a commissioned officer in the Punjab
					Infantry. Your mother was a governess, but she was a lady by birth;
					her father was a clergyman. Your parents met in India; they fell in
					love, and married. Your mother died at your birth, and you came
					home to us. Yes, child, by birth you are a lady, as good as any of
					them—as good as the best."</p>

				<p>"They are dead," said Ruth. "I don't remember them. I have a
					picture of my father upstairs; it is taken with his uniform on. He
					looks very handsome. And I have a little water-color sketch of my
					mother, and she looks fair and sweet and interesting. But I never
					knew them. Those I knew and know and love are you, grandfather, and
					granny."</p>

				<p>"Well, dear, when I had the power and the brains and the
					strength, I kept a shop—a grocer's shop, dear; and my wife, she was
					the daughter of a harness-maker. Your grandparents were both in
					trade; there's no way out of it."</p>

				<p>"But a gentleman and lady for all that," said the girl.</p>

				<p>
					She pressed close to the old man, took one of his
					<!-- Page 15 -->
					<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a> weather-beaten hands between
					both of her own, and stroked it.
				</p>

				<p>"That is as people think, Ruthie; but we weren't in the
					position, and never expect to be, of those who are high up in the
					world."</p>

				<p>"I am glad you told me about my father and mother," said the
					girl. "I love both their memories. I am glad to think that my
					father served the Queen, and that my mother was the daughter of a
					clergyman. But I am more glad to think that there never was such an
					honorable man as you, granddad, and that you made the grocery trade
					one of the best in the world."</p>

				<p>"It was a bad trade, my darling. I had several severe losses.
					It was very unfortunate my lending that money."</p>

				<p>"What money?"</p>

				<p>"Oh, I will tell you another time; it doesn't really matter.
					There was a little bit of ingratitude there, but it doesn't matter.
					Only I made no fortune by grocery—barely enough to put my boy into
					the army and to educate him for it, and enough to keep us with a
					pittance now that we are old. But I have nothing to leave you,
					sweetest. You just have your pension from the Government, which
					don't count for nothing at all."</p>

				<p>Ruth rose to her feet.</p>

				<p>"I am glad I got into the school," she said. "I hope to do
					wonders there. I mean to take every scrap of good the place opens
					out to me. I mean to work as hard as ever I can. You shall be
					desperately proud of me; and so shall granny, although she doesn't
					hold with much learning."</p>

				<p>"But I do, little girl; I love it more than anything. I have
					got such a lovely scheme in my head. I will work alongside of you,
					Ruth—you and I at the same things. You can lend me the books when
					you don't want them."</p>

				<p>
					<!-- Page 16 -->
					<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>"What a splendid idea!" said
					Ruth, clapping her hands.
				</p>

				<p>"You look quite happy, my dear."</p>

				<p>"And so I am. I am about the happiest girl on earth. And now,
					may I begin to look through my lessons for to-morrow?"</p>

				<p>The old man arranged the lamp where its light would be most
					comfortable for the keen young eyes, and Ruth sat down to the
					table, got out her books, and worked for an hour or two. Mrs.
					Craven came in, looked at her proudly, wagged her head, and
					returned to the kitchen. After a time she came to the door and
					beckoned to the old man to follow her. But the old man had taken up
					one of Ruth's books and was absorbed in its contents; he was
					muttering words over under his breath.</p>

				<p>"Coming, wife—coming presently," he said.</p>

				<p>Ruth's head was bent over her books. Mr. Craven rose and went
					on tiptoe into the kitchen.</p>

				<p>"We mustn't disturb her, Susan," he said. "We must let her
					have her own way. She must work just as long as she likes. She is
					going to be a great power in the land, is that child, with her
					beauty and her talent; there's nothing she can't aspire to."</p>

				<p>"Now don't you be a silly old man," said Mrs. Craven. "And
					what on earth were you whispering about to yourself when I came
					in?"</p>

				<p>"I am going to work with her. It will be a wonderful
					stimulation, and a great interest to me. I always was keen for
					book-learning."</p>

				<p>Mrs. Craven suppressed a sigh.</p>

				<p>
					"If I even had fifty pounds," she said, "I wouldn't let that child
					spend every hour at school. I'd dress up smart, and take her out,
					and get her the very best husband I
					<!-- Page 17 -->
					<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a> could. Why, old man, what does
					a woman want with all that learning?"
				</p>

				<p>"If a woman has brains she's bound to use them," replied the
					old man, as he sat down by the kitchen fire.</p>

				<p>Meanwhile Ruth went on with her lessons. After a time,
					however, she uttered a sigh. She flung down her books and looked
					across the room.</p>

				<p>"If he only knew," she said under her breath—"if he only knew
					that I was practically sent to Coventry—that none of the nice girls
					will speak to me. But never mind; I won't tell him. Nothing would
					induce me to trouble him on the subject."</p>

					<h3>HIGH LIFE AND LOW LIFE.</h3>


					<p>
						Amongst the many girls who attended the Great Shirley School was
						one who was known by the name of Cassandra Weldon. She was rapidly
						approaching the proud position of head girl in the school. She had
						entered the Shirley School when quite a little child, had gone
						steadily up through the different classes and the various removes,
						until she found herself nearly at the head of the sixth form. She
						was about to try for a sixty-pound scholarship, renewable for
						three years; if she got it she would go to Holloway College, and
						eventually support herself and her mother. Mrs. Weldon was the
						widow of a man who in his time had a very successful school for
						boys, and she herself had been a teacher long ago in the Great
						Shirley School. Cassandra and her mother, therefore, were from
						<!-- Page 18 -->
						<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a> the very first surrounded by
						scholarship; they belonged, so to speak, to the scholastic world.
					</p>

					<p>Mrs. Weldon could scarcely talk of anything else. Evening
						after evening she would question her daughter eagerly with regard
						to this accomplishment and the other, to this change or that, to
						this chance which Cassandra might have and to the other. The girl
						was extremely clever, with a sort of all-round talent which was
						most remarkable; for in addition to many excellent
						accomplishments, she was distinctly musical. Her musical talent
						very nearly amounted to genius. If in the future she could not
						play in public, she resolved at least to earn her living as a
						music teacher. Mrs. Weldon hoped that Cassandra would do more than
						this; and, to tell the truth, the girl shared her mother's dreams.
						Besides music, she had worked very hard at botany, at French and
						German, and at English literature. She would be seventeen on her
						next birthday, and it was against the rules for any girl to remain
						at the Great Shirley School after that time. Cassandra had,
						however, two more terms of school-life before her, and these terms
						she regarded as the most valuable of her whole education.</p>

					<p>
						In appearance Cassandra was a tall, well-made girl, graceful in
						her movements, and very self-possessed in manner. Her face was
						full of intelligence, but was rather plain than otherwise, for her
						mouth was too wide and her nose the reverse of classical. She had
						bright intelligent brown eyes, however, a nice voice, and a
						pleasant way. Cassandra was looked up to by all her
						fellow-students, and this not because she was rich, nor because
						she was beautiful, but simply because she was good and honorable
						and trustworthy; she possessed a large amount of sympathy
						<!-- Page 19 -->
						<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a> for nearly every one, her tact
						was unfailing, and she was never self-assertive.
					</p>

					<p>Now Cassandra, who had many friends in the school, had
						amongst them, of course, her greatest friend. This girl was called
						Florence Archer. Florence was pretty and clever, but she had
						neither Cassandra's depth nor power of intellect. She was
						naturally vain and frivolous, except in the presence of her
						dearest friend. She was easily influenced by others, and it was
						her habit to follow the one who gave her the last advice. Her
						passionate love for Cassandra was perhaps her best and strongest
						quality; but of late she had exhibited a sense of almost
						unwarrantable jealousy when any other girl showed a preference for
						her special friend. Florence was a very nice girl, but jealousy
						was her bane. She thought a good deal of herself, for her father
						was a rich man, and only took advantage of the Great Shirley
						education because it was incomparably the best in the place. There
						was no rule against any one attending the school, and he had long
						ago secured a niche in it for his favorite daughter. Florence
						loved it and hated it at the same time. She was fond of her own
						companions, but she could not bear the foundation girls. These
						girls made a large percentage in the school. In all respects they
						were supposed to be Florence's equals, but as a matter of fact
						they were kept in a very subordinate position by the paying girls.
						On every possible occasion they were avoided, and there must be
						something very special about any one of them if she was taken up
						by the aristocrats—as they termed themselves—of the school.</p>

					<p>But Cassandra as a rule was perfectly sweet and pleasant to
						the foundation girls, and this trait in her friend's character
						annoyed Florence more than anything else.</p>

					<p>
						On the morning after Ruth Craven had been admitted
						<!-- Page 20 -->
						<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a> to the school Cassandra was
						one of the first arrivals. She was standing in the wide courtyard
						waiting for the school doors to be opened. She looked, as usual,
						bright and capable. A stream of girls were surrounding her, each
						smiling and trying to draw her attention. Cassandra was a girl of
						few words, and after nodding to her companions, she gave them to
						understand that she did not intend to enter into any special
						conversation. Her neat satchel of school-books was slung on her
						arm. She wore a very dark-blue serge dress, and her white
						sailor-hat looked correct and pretty on her shining brown hair.
						Cassandra, with her face beaming as the sun, made a sort of
						figure-head for the smaller girls. Presently three foundation
						girls entered the gates side by side and glanced up at her. This
						trio formed perhaps the most objectionable set in the school. One
						was called Kate Rourke; she was a girl of fifteen years of age,
						showily dressed, with flashing eyes, long earrings in her ears,
						false jewellery round her neck, and a smart, rather shabby hat,
						trimmed with a lot of flowers, placed at the back of her head.
						Hanging on Kate's arm might have been seen Hannah Johnson, in all
						respects that young lady's double. Clara Sawyer, a fair-haired
						little girl about fourteen, with a heavy fringe right down to her
						eyebrows, completed the trio.
					</p>

					<p>They glanced at Cassandra, and then nodded to one another
						and joked and laughed.</p>

					<p>"I have no doubt," said Kate, "that Cassie will take her
						up."</p>

					<p>She said the word "Cassie" in a loud voice. Cassandra heard
						her, but she took not the slightest notice.</p>

					<p>
						"She is safe to," continued Kate. "Now, such a girl oughtn't to be
						on the foundation at all. If you only knew
						<!-- Page 21 -->
						<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a> the snubbing she gave me
						yesterday. I quite hate her, with all her pretty face and her
						mincing ways."
					</p>

					<p>"Never mind, Kitty," said Hannah Johnson. "She may snub you
						as much as she likes, but you have got me to cling on to."</p>

					<p>"And you've got me, too, Kitty," said Clara Sawyer. She
						snuggled close up to Kate and slipped her hand through her arm.</p>

					<p>"Nasty thing!" said Hannah. "I feel every word you say,
						Kate. Do you know, I offered to walk home with her yesterday, and
						she said, 'No, I thank you; I prefer to walk home alone,'"</p>

					<p>As Hannah made this speech she adopted the mincing tones
						which she supposed Ruth Craven had used. The two other girls burst
						out laughing.</p>

					<p>"Oh, do say what you are laughing about!" said another girl,
						running up to the group at this moment. Her name was Rosy Myers.
						"You always have a joke among you three, and I want to share it.
						Do say—do say! I've got a lot of toffee in my pocket."</p>

					<p>"Hand it out, Rosy, and perhaps we'll tell you," said Kate.</p>

					<p>Rose produced a packet of sticky sweetmeat, and a moment
						later the four were sucking peppermint toffee and making
						themselves thoroughly objectionable to their neighbors.</p>

					<p>"But what about the girl—the person you are laughing about?"
						asked Rose.</p>

					<p>
						"Oh, it's that stupid, tiresome Ruth Craven," answered Hannah.
						"Why, she's nobody. The governors and the mistress ought not to
						allow such a girl in the school. It's all very well to be on the
						foundation, but there are limits. Why, her old grandfather kept
						nothing better than a
						<!-- Page 22 -->
						<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a> huckster's shop. It doesn't
						seem right that a girl of that sort should belong to this school,
						and then take airs."
					</p>

					<p>"But the question is," said Cassandra suddenly, "does she
						take airs?"</p>

					<p>The girls all stopped talking, and gazed up at Cassandra
						with astonishment in their faces.</p>

					<p>"I have overheard you," said Miss Weldon calmly. "I presume
						you are alluding to Miss Craven?"</p>

					<p>"We are talking about Ruth Craven," said Kate Rourke; "and
						you will excuse me, Cassie, but I never saw a girl more chock-full
						of pride. She is so conceited that she is intolerable."</p>

					<p>"I heard of her yesterday, but have not had an opportunity
						to form any estimate of her character," continued Cassandra. "I
						should prefer that you did not call me Cassie, if you please,
						Kate. I will watch her and find out if I agree with you. I only
						noticed yesterday that she is remarkably pretty. I will ask her to
						walk home with me to-day and have tea. I should like to introduce
						her to mother."</p>

					<p>"Well, I never!" said Hannah. "And you really mean that you
						would introduce that girl to Mrs. Weldon?"</p>

					<p>"I think so. Yes, I am almost certain. Here she comes. I
						like her face. Don't let her hear you giggling, please, Kate; it
						is very unkind to make a new girl feel uncomfortable."</p>

					<p>Kate smothered a laugh and turned away. The doors of the
						school were now thrown open, and the girls disappeared by their
						special entrances.</p>

					<p>
						It was just at that moment that Ruth in her shabby dress, but with
						her sweet and most beautiful face, joined the group of girls who
						were going into the school. She was without a companion. The other
						girls went in by
						<!-- Page 23 -->
						<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a> twos, each clinging to her
						special crony. Cassandra now changed her position, and found
						herself within a yard or two of Ruth Craven. She was examining
						Ruth with great care, but not at all from the unkind point of
						view; hers was a sympathetic aspect. That little old serge dress
						made something come up in Cassandra's throat, and she longed
						beyond words to give her a better dress. Ruth's hat, too, left
						much to be desired. It was an old black sailor-hat, which had been
						burnt to a dull brown. But, notwithstanding the hat and the dress,
						there was the face. The face was most lovely, and the back of the
						shabby frock was covered by hair as black as jet, and curling and
						rippling in the sunshine.
					</p>

					<p>"What wouldn't every other girl in the school give to have
						such a face as that, and such hair as that?" thought Cassandra. "I
						must speak to her."</p>

					<p>She was just bending forward, meaning to touch Ruth on her
						shoulder, when there came a commotion near the entrance, and the
						excited face of Alice Tennant came into view. Alice was
						accompanied by a tall, showily dressed girl. The girl had a very
						vivid color in her cheeks, intensely bright and roguish dark-blue
						eyes, light chestnut hair touched with gold—hair which was a mass
						of waves and tendrils and fluffiness, and on which a little
						dark-blue velvet cap was placed.</p>

					<p>"I am not going to be shy," cried the new-comer in a hearty,
						clear, loud voice with a considerable amount of brogue in it.
						"Leave off clutching me by the arm, Alice, my honey, for see my
						new companions I will. Ah, what a crowd of girls!—colleens we call
						them in Ireland. Oh, glory! how am I ever to get the names of half
						of them round my tongue? Ah, and isn't that one a beauty?"</p>

					<p>
						<!-- Page 24 -->
						<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>"Hush, Kathleen—do hush!" said
						Alice. "They will hear you."
					</p>

					<p>"And what do I care if they do, darling? It doesn't matter
						to me. I mean to talk to that girl; she's won my heart entirely."</p>

					<p>Before Alice could prevent her, the Irish girl had sprung
						forward, pushed a couple of Great Shirley girls out of their
						places, and had taken Ruth Craven by the arm.</p>

					<p>"It's a kiss I'm going to give you, my beauty," she said.
						"Oh, it's right glad I am to see you! My name is Kathleen O'Hara,
						and I hail from the ould country. Ah, though! it's lonely I'm
						likely to be, isn't it, deary? You don't deny me the pleasure of
						your society when I tell you that in all this vast crowd I stand
						solitary—solitary but for her; and, bedad! I'm not certain that I
						take to her at all. Let me tuck my hand inside your arm,
						sweetest."</p>

					<p>A titter was heard from the surrounding girls. Ruth turned
						very red, then she looked into Kathleen's eyes.</p>

					<p>"You mean kindly," she said, "but perhaps you had better
						not. You, too, are a stranger."</p>

					<p>"Are you a stranger?" asked Kathleen. "Then that clinches
						the matter. Ah, yes; it's lonely I am. I have come from my dear
						mountain home to be civilised; but civilisation will never suit
						Kathleen O'Hara. She isn't meant to have it. She's meant to dance
						on the tops of the mountains, and to gather flowers in the bogs.
						She's made to dance and joke and laugh, and to have a gay time.
						Ah! my people at home made a fine mistake when they sent me to be
						civilised. But I like you, honey. I like the shape of your face,
						and the way you are made, and the wonderful look in your eyes when
						you glance round at me. It is you and me will be the finest of
						friends, sha'n't we?"</p>

					<p>
						<!-- Page 25 -->
						<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>Before Ruth could reply the
						girls had entered the great hall, which presently became quite
						full.
					</p>

					<p>"Don't let go of me, darling, for the life of you. It's lost
						I'd be in a place of this sort. Let me clutch on to you until they
						put me into the lowest place in the school."</p>

					<p>"But why so?" asked Ruth, glancing at her tall companion in
						some astonishment. "Don't you know anything?"</p>

					<p>"I? Never a bit, darling. I don't suppose they'll keep me
						here. I have no learning, and I never want to have any, and what's
						more—"</p>

					<p>"Hush, girls! No talking," called the indignant voice of a
						form-room mistress.</p>

					<p>Kathleen's dark-blue eyes grew round with laughter. She
						suddenly dropped a curtsy.</p>

					<p>"Mum's the word, ma'am," she said, and then she glanced
						round at her numerous companions.</p>

					<p>The girls had all been watching her. Their faces broke into
						smiles, the smiles became titters, and the titters roars. The
						mistress had again to come forward and ask what was wrong.</p>

					<p>"It's only me, miss," said Kathleen, "so don't blame any of
						the other innocent lambs. I'm fresh from old Ireland. Oh, miss,
						it's a beautiful country! Were you never there? If you could only
						behold her purple mountains, and let yourself go on the bosom of
						her rushing streams! Were you ever in the old country, miss, if I
						might venture to ask a civil question?"</p>

					<p>"No," said Miss Atherton in a very suppressing tone. "I
						don't understand impertinent questions, and I expect the
						schoolgirls to be orderly.—Ah, Ruth Craven! Will you take this
						young lady under your wing?"</p>

					<p>
						"Didn't I say we were to be mates, dear?" said Kathleen
						<!-- Page 26 -->
						<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a> O'Hara; and as they passed
						from the great hall, Kathleen's hand was still fondly linked on
						Ruth's arm.

						<h3>THE WILD IRISH GIRL.</h3>


						<p>Lessons went on in their usual orderly fashion. At eleven
							o'clock there was a break for a quarter of an hour. The girls
							streamed into the playground. The playground was very large, and
							was asphalted, and in consequence quite dry and pleasant to walk
							on. There was a field just beyond, and into this field the girls
							now strolled by twos and twos. Kathleen O'Hara clung to Ruth
							Craven's arm; she kept talking to her and asking her questions.</p>

						<p>"You needn't reply unless you like, pet," she said. "All I
							want is just to look into your face. I adore beauty; I worship it
							more than anything else on earth. I was brought up in the midst
							of it. I never saw anything uglier than poor old Towser when he
							broke his leg and cut his upper jaw; but although he was ugly, he
							was the darling of my heart. He died, and I cried a lot. I can't
							quite get over it. Yes, I suppose I am uncivilised, and I never
							want to be anything else. Do you think I want to copy those
							nimby-pimby girls over there, or that lot, or that?"</p>

						<p>"You had better not point, please, Miss O'Hara," said Ruth.
							"They won't like it."</p>

						<p>
							"What do I care whether they like it or not?" said Kathleen. "I
							wasn't brought here to curry favor with them. What would my
							darling father say if I told him that I was going to curry favor
							with the girls of the Great
							<!-- Page 27 -->
							<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a> Shirley School? And what
							would mother say? No, no; I may pick up a few smatterings, or I
							may not, but there is one thing certain: I mean to make a friend
							of you, Ruth—yes, a great big bosom friend. You will be fond of
							me, won't you?"
						</p>

						<p>"I like you now," said Ruth. "I know you are kind, and you
							are very pretty."</p>

						<p>"Why, then, darling," said Kathleen, "is it the Blarney
							Stone you have kissed? You have a sweet little voice of your own,
							although it hasn't the dear touch of the brogue that I miss so in
							all the other girls."</p>

						<p>"But you like Miss Tennant don't you?" said Ruth.</p>

						<p>"Oh, yes. Poor little Alice! She's very reserved and very,
							very formal, but she's a good soul, and I won't worry her. But
							you are the one my heart has gone out to. Ah! that is the way of
							Irish hearts. They go straight out to their kindred spirits. You
							are a kindred spirit of mine, Ruth Craven, and you can't get away
							from me, not even if you will."</p>

						<p>The fifteen minutes for recreation came to an end, and the
							girls returned to the schoolroom. Ruth was in a high class for
							her age, and was already absorbed in her work. Kathleen drummed
							with her fingers on her desk and looked round her. Kathleen was
							in a low class; she was with girls a great deal smaller and
							younger than herself.</p>

						<p>"How old are you, Miss O'Hara?" the English teacher, Miss
							Dove, had said.</p>

						<p>"I am fifteen, bless your heart, darling!" replied
							Kathleen.</p>

						<p>"Don't talk exactly like that," said Miss Dove, who, in
							spite of herself, was attracted by the sweet voice and sweeter
							eyes. "Say, 'I am fifteen, Miss Dove.'"</p>

						<p>
							Kathleen made a grimace. Her grimace was so comical
							<!-- Page 28 -->
							<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a> that all the small girls in
							the class burst out laughing. She was silent.
						</p>

						<p>"Speak, dear," said Miss Dove in a persuasive tone.</p>

						<p>"Yes, darling, I'm trying to."</p>

						<p>"You mustn't use affectionate words in school."</p>

						<p>"Oh, my heart! How am I to bear it?" said Kathleen, and she
							clasped a white hand over that organ.</p>

						<p>Miss Dove paused for a moment, and then decided that she
							would let the question in dispute go by for the present. She
							began to question Kathleen as to her acquirements, and found that
							she must leave her with the younger children for the time being.
							She then went on to attend to other duties.</p>

						<p>Kathleen sat bolt-upright in the centre of the class. It
							seemed absurd to see this tall, well-grown girl surrounded by
							tiny tots. One of the tiny tots looked towards her. Presently she
							thrust out a moist little hand, and out of the moisture produced
							a half-melted peppermint drop. Just for a second Kathleen's
							bright eyes fell upon the sweetmeat with disgust; then she took
							it up gingerly and popped it into her mouth.</p>

						<p>"It's golloptious," she said, turning to the child, and
							then she drummed her fingers once more on the edge of the desk.
							Presently she stooped down and whispered to this small girl:</p>

						<p>"I hate school; don't you?"</p>

						<p>"Y—es," was the timid reply.</p>

						<p>"Let's go out."</p>

						<p>"But I—I can't."</p>

						<p>"I must, then. I have nothing to do; the lessons are deadly
							stupid. Forgive me, girls; you are all blameless;" and the next
							moment she had left the room.</p>

						<p>
							Half a moment later she was in the fresh air outside.
							<!-- Page 29 -->
							<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a> Her cheeks were hot, her hair
							in disorder, and her hand, where she had touched the peppermint,
							was sticky."
						</p>

						<p>"What would father say if he could see me now?" she
							thought. "If Aunty O'Flynn was to look at her Kathleen! Oh, why
							did they send me across the cold sea to a place of this sort—a
							detestable place? Oh, the fresh air is reviving. I was born free,
							and Britons never, never will be slaves. I can't stay in that
							horrid room. Oh, how long the morning is!"</p>

						<p>Just then a teacher came out and beckoned to Kathleen.</p>

						<p>"What are you doing outside, Miss O'Hara? Come in
							immediately and return to your class."</p>

						<p>"I can't dear," replied Kathleen in a gentle tone. "You are
							young, aren't you? You don't look more than twenty. Do you ever
							feel your heart beat wild, dear, and your spirits all in a sort
							of throb? And did you, when you were like that, submit to being
							tied up in steel chains all round every bit of you? Answer me:
							did you?"</p>

						<p>"I can't answer you, Miss O'Hara. You are a very naughty,
							rebellious girl. You have come to school to be disciplined. Go
							back immediately."</p>

						<p>For a minute Kathleen thought of rebelling, but then she
							said to herself, "It isn't worth the fuss," and returned to her
							place once again in the centre of the class.</p>

						<p>"I have been called back," she said in a whisper to her
							little peppermint companion. "I was naughty to go out, and I am
							called back. I am in disgrace. Isn't it a lark?"</p>

						<p>The little girl felt quite excited. Never was there such
							and big and fascinating inmate of the lower fifth before. It was
							worth coming to school now to be in the vicinity of one so
							handsome and so gay.</p>

						<p>
							The weary morning came to an end at last. The girls seldom
							returned for afternoon school, generally doing their
							<!-- Page 30 -->
							<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a> preparations at home. Alice
							Tennant, however, sometimes preferred the quiet school to the
							noisy life she lived with her brothers at home. She looked now
							eagerly for Kathleen, who had shunned her from the instant they
							had entered the school; she stood just by the gate waiting for
							her. Kathleen, on her part, was looking for Ruth Craven. Ruth had
							been monopolised by Cassandra Weldon.
						</p>

						<p>"You must come home with me," she said.</p>

						<p>"But my grandparents will be expecting me," said Ruth.</p>

						<p>"Never mind; we will go round by your cottage and ask them.
							I know all about you, and I want to know you better. You will,
							won't you?"</p>

						<p>"Thank you very much," said Ruth.</p>

						<p>"We will go on at once without waiting for the others,"
							said Cassandra, and they walked on quickly, while Kathleen
							searched in vain for her chosen friend.</p>

						<p>"Come, Kathleen; I am waiting," said Alice in a slightly
							cross voice. "Mother said we were to be home early to-day."</p>

						<p>"All right," said Kathleen; "but I can't find Miss Craven
							anywhere.</p>

						<p>"You can't wait for her now. Indeed, she has gone. I saw
							her walking down the road with Cassandra Weldon."</p>

						<p>"And who is she?"</p>

						<p>"The head girl of the school; and such a splendid creature!
							I am glad she is taking up Ruth. It isn't possible for every one
							to notice her; although, for my part, I have no patience with
							that sort of false pride. Of course, a lot of the foundation
							girls are very common; but when one sees a perfect lady like Ruth
							one ought to recognize her."</p>

						<p>"Of course," said Kathleen, fidgeting a little as she
							walked.</p>

						<p>
							<!-- Page 31 -->
							<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>"And how did you get on?"
							asked Alice, noticing the dejected tone of her voice.
						</p>

						<p>"I got on abominably," said Kathleen.</p>

						<p>"What class are you in?"</p>

						<p>"I don't know. I am with a lot of babies; I suppose I am to
							be a sort of caretaker to them. There wasn't anything to learn. I
							am going to write to father. I can't stay in that horrid school."</p>

						<p>"Oh, yes, you can. You will get to like it very much after
							a time. You have never been at school before, and of course you
							find it irksome."</p>

						<p>"Is it irksome?" cried Kathleen. "Is it that she calls it?
							Oh, glory! It's purgatory, my dear, that's what it
							is—purgatory—and I haven't done anything to deserve it."</p>

						<p>"But you want to learn; you don't want to be always
							ignorant."</p>

						<p>
							"Bedad, then, darling, I don't want to learn at all. What do I
							want to know your sort of things for? I could beat you, every one
							of you, and the teachers, too, in some accomplishments. Put me on
							a horse, darling, and see what I can do; and put me in a boat,
							pet, and find out where I can take you. And set me swimming in
							the cold sea; I can turn somersaults and dive and dance on the
							waves, and do every mortal thing as though I were a fish, not a
							girl. And give me a gun and see me bring down a bird on the wing.
							Ah! those things ought to be counted in the education of a woman.
							I can do all those things, and I can mix whisky punch, and I can
							sing songs to the dear old dad, and I can comfort my mother when
							her rheumatics are bad. And I can love, love, love! Oh, no,
							Alice, I am not ignorant in the true sense; but I hate French,
							and I hate arithmetic, and I hate all your horrid
							<!-- Page 32 -->
							<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a> school work. And I never
							could spell properly; and what does it matter?"
						</p>

						<p>"Everything," replied Alice. "You can't go about the world
							if you are stupid and ignorant."</p>

						<p>"Can't I?" exclaimed Kathleen, and she flashed her eyes at
							Alice and made her feel, as she said afterwards, quite uncanny.</p>

						<p>The Tennants were, after all, not a large family. They
							consisted of Mrs. Tennant, Alice, and two young brothers. These
							brothers were schoolboys of the unruly type. Alice considered
							them very badly trained. Kathleen, however, was much taken by
							their schoolboyish ways.</p>

						<p>As the two girls now entered the house they heard a whistle
							proceeding from the attic; a cat-call at the same time came from
							the basement.</p>

						<p>"Oh, dear!" cried Alice, "there are those dreadful boys
							again. Whatever you do, Kathleen, you must not encourage them in
							their larks."</p>

						<p>"But why shouldn't I? I like them both. I call David a
							broth of a boy. I am glad you have got brothers, Alice. I haven't
							any; but then I have lots of boy cousins, which comes to much the
							same thing."</p>

						<p>The girls by this time had reached the large bedroom which
							they shared on the first floor.</p>

						<p>"You are welcome to my brothers if you don't toss all your
							things about in my room," cried Alice. "If we are to sleep
							together we must be orderly."</p>

						<p>"Orderly, is it?" cried Kathleen. "I don't know the meaning
							of the word. Well, all right, I'm ready."</p>

						<p>She pushed her fingers through her tangled golden hair,
							and, without glancing at herself in the glass, marched out of the
							room.</p>

						<p>
							"I wish mother hadn't asked her to come," said Alice
							<!-- Page 33 -->
							<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a> to herself. "The house was
							bad enough before, but now she will make things past bearing."
						</p>

						<p>Alice went downstairs to the sound of a cracked gong. The
							Tennants had their meals in a sitting-room on the second floor.
							It was barely furnished, and had kamptulicon instead of a carpet
							on the floor. Mrs. Tennant, looking careworn and anxious, was
							seated at the head of the table; her dress was somewhat faded.
							Alice entered and took her seat at the foot. Kathleen was nowhere
							to be seen.</p>

						<p>"I have only soup and fish for dinner to-day," said Mrs.
							Tennant. "I do trust Kathleen will be satisfied."</p>

						<p>Alice frowned at her mother in some displeasure.</p>

						<p>"We ought to have meat—" she was beginning, when there came
							a bang and a scuffle, a girlish laugh, and Kathleen, leaning
							fondly on both the boys, appeared. Mrs. Tennant pointed to a
							seat, and she sat down. The Irish girl had a healthy appetite,
							and was indifferent to what she ate. She demanded two plates of
							soup, and when she had finished the second she looked at Mrs.
							Tennant and said emphatically:</p>

						<p>"I have fallen in love."</p>

						<p>"My dear Kathleen!"</p>

						<p>"I have—with a girl, so it doesn't matter. She's the
							prettiest, sweetest, bonniest thing I ever saw in my life. I am
							going to hunt round for her immediately after dinner. I thought
							I'd say so, for I mean to do it."</p>

						<p>
							"Oh, Kathleen!" said Alice in a distressed voice, "you really
							mustn't. You must come back to the school with me. I promised
							Miss Dove that I'd see you through your tasks.—You know, mother,"
							continued Alice, "Kathleen is not very advanced for her age, and
							Miss Dove wants to get her into a proper class as quickly as
							possible; therefore
							<!-- Page 34 -->
							<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a> she is to be coached a
							little, and I have undertaken to do it.—You will come with me,
							Kathleen? I must get back to the school again by half-past two.
							You will be sure to come, dear?"
						</p>

						<p>"I think not, dear," replied Kathleen in her most
							aggravating tone.</p>

						<p>"But you must.—Mustn't she, mother?"</p>

						<p>"You ought to, Kathleen," said Mrs. Tennant. "You have been
							sent here to learn. Alice can teach you; she can help you very
							much. She means to be very kind to you. You certainly ought to do
							what she suggests."</p>

						<p>"But I am afraid," said Kathleen, "that I am not going to
							do what I ought. I don't wish to be good at all to-day. I
							couldn't live if I wasn't really naughty sometimes. I mean to be
							terribly naughty all the afternoon. If you will let me have my
							fling, I do assure you, Mrs. Tennant, that I will work off the
							steam, and will be all right to-morrow. I must do something
							desperate, and if Alice opposes me I'll have to do something
							worse."</p>

						<p>"You are a clipper!" said David Tennant, smiling into her
							face.</p>

						<p>"All right, my boy; I expect I am," said Kathleen; and then
							she added, springing to her feet, "I have eaten enough, and for
							what we have received—Good-bye, Mrs. Tennant; I'm off."</p>

							<h3>THE HOME-SICK AND THE REBELLIOUS.</h3>


							<p>
								Kathleen O'Hara ran up to an untidy room. She banged-to the
								door, and standing by it for a moment, drew the bolt. Thus she
								had secured herself against intrusion.
								<!-- Page 35 -->
								<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a> She then flung herself on
								the bed, put her two arms under her head, and gazed out of the
								window. Her heart was beating wildly; she had a strange medley
								of feelings within. She was desperately, madly lonely. She was
								homesick in the most intense sense of the word.
							</p>

							<p>Kathleen had never left Carrigrohane Castle before. This
								romantic abode was situated in the extreme south-west of
								Ireland. It was a mile away from the sea, and stood on a rocky
								eminence which overlooked a very wide expanse of moor and wood,
								rushing streams and purple mountains, and deep dark-blue sea. In
								the whole world there could scarcely be found a more lovely view
								than that which since her birth had presented itself before
								Kathleen's young eyes. Her father, Squire O'Hara, was, as
								landlords in Ireland go, very well off. His tenantry adored him.
								He got in his rents with tolerable regularity. He was a good
								landlord, firm but also kind and indulgent. A real case of
								distress was never turned away from his doors, but where rent
								could be paid he insisted on the cottars giving him his due. He
								kept a rather wild establishment, however. His wife was an
								Irishwoman from a neighboring county, and had some of the most
								careless attributes of her race. The house got along anyhow.
								There were always shoals of visitors, mostly relatives. There
								were heavy feasts in the old hall, and sittings up very late at
								night, and no end of hunting and fishing and shooting in their
								seasons. In the summer a pretty white yacht made a great
								"divartisement," as the Squire was fond of saying; and in all
								things Kathleen O'Hara was free as the air she breathed. She was
								educated in a sort of fashion by an Irish governess, but in
								reality she was allowed to pursue her lessons exactly as she
								liked best herself.</p>

							<p>
								It was just before she was fifteen that Kathleen's aunt,
								<!-- Page 36 -->
								<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a> a maiden lady from Dublin,
								who rejoiced in the truly Irish name of O'Flynn, came to see
								them, remarked on Kathleen's wild, unkempt appearance, declared
								that the girl would be a downright beauty when she was eighteen,
								said that no one would tolerate such a want of knowledge in the
								present day, and advised that she should go to school. Mrs.
								O'Hara took Miss O'Flynn's hint very much to heart. Kathleen was
								consulted, and of course tabooed the entire scheme; in the end,
								however, the elder ladies carried the day. Miss O'Flynn took her
								niece to Dublin with her, and gave her an expensive and very
								unnecessary wardrobe; and Mrs. O'Hara, having heard a great deal
								of Mrs. Tennant, who had Irish relatives, decided that Kathleen
								should go to the Great Shirley School, where she herself had
								been educated long ago. Everything was arranged in a great
								hurry. It seemed to Kathleen now, as she lay on her bed, kicking
								her feet impatiently, and ruffled her beautiful hair, that the
								thing had come to pass in a flash. It seemed only yesterday that
								she was at home in the old house, petted by the servants, adored
								by her father, worshipped by all her relatives—the young queen
								of the castle, free as the air, followed by her dogs, riding on
								her pony—and now she was here in this hideous, poor, fifth-class
								house, going to that ugly school.
							</p>

							<p>"I can't stand it," she thought. "There's only one way
								out. I must have a real desperate burst of naughtiness. What
								shall I do that will most aggravate them? For do that thing I
								will, and as quickly as possible."</p>

							<p>Kathleen thought rapidly. She had no brothers of her own,
								but their loss was made up for by the adoration of about twenty
								young cousins who were always loafing about the place and
								following Kathleen wherever she turned.</p>

							<p>
								"What would most aggravate Pat if he were here,"
								<!-- Page 37 -->
								<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a> thought the girl, "or dear
								old Michael? Ah, well! Michael—" The girl's face slightly
								changed. "I was never <i>very</i> naughty with Michael," she
								said to herself. "He is different from the others. I wouldn't
								like to see that sort of sorry look in his dear dark-blue eyes.
								Oh, I mustn't think of Michael now. When I was going away he
								said, 'Bedad, you'll come back a princess, and I'll be proud to
								see you.' No, I mustn't think of Michael. Pat, the imp, would
								help me, and so would Rory, and so would Ted. But what shall it
								be?"
							</p>

							<p>She thought excitedly. There came a rattle at the handle
								of the door.</p>

							<p>"Let me in, please, Kathleen; let me in," called Alice's
								voice.</p>

							<p>"Presently, darling," replied Kathleen in her most
								nonchalant tone.</p>

							<p>"But I am in a hurry. I must be back at school by
								half-past two. Let me in immediately."</p>

							<p>"What a nuisance it all is!" thought Kathleen. "But, after
								all, my naughtiness needn't make that stupid old Alice late for
								her darling lessons."</p>

							<p>She scrambled off the bed, drew back the bolt, and
								returned to her old position. Alice came quickly in. She glanced
								at Kathleen with disgust.</p>

							<p>"I wish you wouldn't lie on the bed in your muddy boots."</p>

							<p>No answer.</p>

							<p>"I must ask you not to lock the door. It is my room as
								well as yours."</p>

							<p>No answer. Kathleen's eyes were fixed on the window; they
								were brimful of mischief. After a time she said:</p>

							<p>"Darling."</p>

							<p>"I wish you wouldn't talk to me in that silly way."</p>

							<p>
								<!-- Page 38 -->
								<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>"Faith! honey, then."
							</p>

							<p>"I do wish—"</p>

							<p>Kathleen suddenly sprang upright on her bed.</p>

							<p>"Don't you like the sky when it looks as it does now? I
								wish you could see it from Carrigrohane. You don't know the sort
								of expression it has when it seems to be kissing the sea. We
								have a ghost at Carrigrohane. Oh, wisha, then, if you only could
								see it! I can tell the boys about it. Sha'n't I make them
								creep?"</p>

							<p>"It is very silly to talk about ghosts. Nobody believes in
								them," said Alice.</p>

							<p>"I'll ask father if I may have you at Carrigrohane in the
								summer, and then see if you don't believe. She wears white."</p>

							<p>"I am going out now, Kathleen; aren't you coming with me?"</p>

							<p>"No, thank you, my love."</p>

							<p>"You ought to, Kathleen. I am busy preparing for my
								scholarship examination or I would stay and argue with you. It
								is an awful pity to have gone to the expense of coming here if
								you don't mean to do your utmost."</p>

							<p>"Thank you, darling, but it is rather a waste of breath
								for you to talk so long to me. I mean to be naughty this
								afternoon."</p>

							<p>"I can't help you," said Alice. "I am very sorry you ever
								came."</p>

							<p>"Thank you so much, dear."</p>

							<p>Alice ran downstairs.</p>

							<p>"Mother," she said, rushing into her mother's presence,
								"we shall have no end of trouble with that terrible girl. She is
								lying now on the bed with her outdoor boots on, and she won't
								come to school, or do a single thing I want her to."</p>

							<p>
								<!-- Page 39 -->
								<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>"The money her father pays
								will be very welcome, Alice. We must bear with some discomforts
								on account of that."
							</p>

							<p>"I suppose so," said Alice, shrugging her shoulders. "How
								horrid it is to be poor, and to have such a girl as that in the
								house! Well, I can't stay another minute. You had better keep a
								sort of general eye on her, mother, for there's no saying what
								she will do. She has declared her intention of being naughty.
								She knows no fear, is not guided by any sort of principle, and
								would, in short, do anything."</p>

							<p>"Well, go to school, Alice, and be quick home, for I have
								a great deal I want you to help me with."</p>

							<p>Alice made no reply, and Mrs. Tennant, after thinking for
								a minute, went upstairs. She knocked at the door of the room
								which she had given up to the two girls. There was no answer.
								She opened it and went in. The bird had flown. There were
								evident signs of a stampede through the window, for it stood
								wide open, and there were marks of not too clean boots on the
								drugget, and a torn piece of ivy just without. The window was
								twenty feet from the ground, and Kathleen must have let herself
								down by the sturdy arm of the old ivy. Mrs. Tennant looked out,
								half expecting to see a mangled body on the ground; but there
								was no one in view. She returned to her darning and her anxious
								thoughts.</p>

							<p>
								She was a widow with two sons and a daughter, and something
								under two hundred and fifty pounds a year on which to live. To
								educate the boys, to do something for Alice, and to put
								bread-and-butter into all their mouths was a difficult problem
								to solve in these expensive days. She had on purpose moved close
								to the Great Shirley School in order to avail herself of its
								cheap education for Alice.
								<!-- Page 40 -->
								<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a> The boys went to another
								foundation school near by; and altogether the family managed to
								scrape along. But the advent of Kathleen on the scene was a
								great relief, for her father paid three guineas a week for Mrs.
								Tennant's motherly care and for Kathleen's board and lodging.
							</p>

							<p>"Poor child!" thought the good woman. "What a wild,
								undisciplined, handsome creature she is! I must do what I can
								for her."</p>

							<p>She sat on for some time darning and thinking. Her heart
								was full; she felt depressed. She had been working in various
								ways ever since six o'clock that morning, and the darning of the
								boys' rough socks hurt her eyes and made her fingers ache.</p>

							<p>Meanwhile Kathleen was running along the road. She ran
								until she was completely out of breath. She then came to a
								stile, against which she leant. By-and-by she saw a girl walking
								leisurely up the road; she was a shabbily dressed and rather
								vulgar girl. Kathleen saw at once that she was one of the Great
								Shirley girls, so she went forward and spoke to her.</p>

							<p>"You go to our school, don't you?" she said.</p>

							<p>"Yes, miss," answered the girl, dropping a little curtsy
								when she saw Kathleen. She was a very fresh foundation girl, and
								recognized something in Kathleen which caused her to be more
								subservient than was necessary.</p>

							<p>"Then, if you please," continued Kathleen, "can you tell
								me where that sweetly pretty girl, Ruth Craven, lives?"</p>

							<p>"She isn't a lady," said the girl, whose name was Susan
								Hopkins. "She is no more a lady than I am."</p>

							<p>"Indeed she is," said Kathleen. "She is a great deal more
								of a lady than you are."</p>

							<p>The girl flushed.</p>

							<p>
								"You are a Great Shirley girl yourself," she said. "I
								<!-- Page 41 -->
								<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a> saw you there to-day. You
								are in an awfully low class. Do you like sitting with the little
								kids? I saw you towering up in the middle of them like a
								mountain."
							</p>

							<p>Kathleen's eyes flashed.</p>

							<p>"What is your name?" she asked.</p>

							<p>"Susan Hopkins. I used to be a Board School girl, but now
								I am on the foundation at Great Shirley. It is a big rise for
								me. Are you a poor girl? Are you on the foundation?"</p>

							<p>"I don't know what it means by being on the foundation,
								but I don't think I am poor. I think, on the contrary, that I am
								very rich. Did you ever hear of a girl who lived in a castle—a
								great beautiful castle—on the top of a high hill? If you ever
								did, I am that girl."</p>

							<p>"Oh, my!" said Susy Hopkins. "That does sound romantic."</p>

							<p>Her momentary dislike to Kathleen had vanished. The desire
								to go to the town on a message for her mother had completely
								left her. She stood still, as though fascinated.</p>

							<p>"I live there," said Kathleen—"that is, I do when I am at
								home. I come from the land of the mountain and the stream; of
								the shamrock; of the deep, deep blue sea."</p>

							<p>"Ireland? Are you Irish?" said the girl.</p>

							<p>"I am proud to say that I am."</p>

							<p>"We don't think anything of the Irish here."</p>

							<p>"Oh, don't you?"</p>

							<p>"But don't be angry, please," continued Susy, "for I am
								sure you are very nice."</p>

							<p>"I am nice when I like. To-day I am nasty. I am wicked
								to-day—quite wicked; I could hate any one who opposes me. I want
								some one to help me; if some one will help me, I will be nice to
								that person. Will you?"</p>

							<p>
								<!-- Page 42 -->
								<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>"Oh, my word, yes! How
								handsome you look when you flash your eyes!" said Susy Hopkins.
							</p>

							<p>"Then I want to find that dear little girl, who is so
								beautiful that I love her and can't get her out of my head. I
								want to find Ruth Craven. She went away with a horrid, stiff,
								pokery girl called Cassandra Weldon. You have such strange names
								in your country. That horrid, prim Cassandra chose to correct me
								when I came into school, and she has taken my darling away—the
								only one I love in the whole of England. I want to find her. I
								will give you—- I will give you an Irish diamond set in a brooch
								if you will help me."</p>

							<p>This sounded a very grand offer indeed to Susy Hopkins,
								who lived in the most modest way, and had not a jewel of any
								sort in her possession.</p>

							<p>"I will help you. I will, and I can. I know where Miss
								Weldon lives. I can take you to her house."</p>

							<p>"But I want Ruth."</p>

							<p>"If she has taken Ruth home, she will be at Cassandra's
								house," said Susy.</p>

							<p>"And you can take me there?"</p>

							<p>"This blessed minute."</p>

							<p>"All right; come along."</p>

							<p>"When will you give me the diamond set in the brooch?"</p>

							<p>"It isn't a real diamond, you know. It is an Irish diamond
								set in silver—real silver. My old nurse had it made for me, and
								I wear it sometimes. I will bring it to you to school
								to-morrow."</p>

							<p>"Oh, thank you—thank you, Miss—I forgot your name."</p>

							<p>"O'Hara—Kathleen O'Hara."</p>

							<p>"O'Hara is rather a difficult name to say. May I call you
								Kathleen?"</p>

							<p>
								<!-- Page 43 -->
								<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>"Just as you please, Susan.
								It is more handy for me to say Susan than Hopkins. As long as I
								am in England I must consort, I see, with all kinds of people;
								and if you will make yourself useful to me, I will be good to
								you."
							</p>

							<p>Susy turned and led the way in the direction of Cassandra
								Weldon's home. They had to walk across a very wide field, then
								down a narrow lane, then up a steep hill, and then into a
								valley. At the bottom of the valley was a straight road, and at
								each side of the road were neat little houses—small and very
								proper-looking. Each house consisted of two stories, with a hall
								door in the middle and a sitting room on each side. There were
								three windows overhead, and one or two attics in the roof. The
								houses were very compact; they were new, and were called by
								ambitious names. For instance, the house where the Weldons lived
								went by the ambitious name of Sans Souci. All through the walk
								Susy chatted for the benefit of her companion. She told Kathleen
								so much about her life that she was interested in spite of
								herself! and by the time they arrived outside Sans Souci,
								Kathleen's hand was lying affectionately on her companion's arm.</p>

							<p>"I had best not go in, miss," she said. "Cassandra Weldon
								would never take the very least notice of me; and none of us
								foundation girls like her at all."</p>

							<p>"Well, it is extremely unfair," said Kathleen. "From all
								you have been telling me, the foundation girls must be
								particularly clever. I tell you what it is: I think I shall take
								to you."</p>

							<p>"Oh, would you, indeed, miss?" said Susy, her eyes
								sparkling. "There are a hundred of us, you know, in the school."</p>

							<p>"That is a great number. And Ruth Craven is really one?"</p>

							<p>
								<!-- Page 44 -->
								<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>"She is, miss. She isn't a
								bit better than the rest of us."
							</p>

							<p>"And I love her already."</p>

							<p>"She is no better than the rest of us," repeated Susan
								Hopkins.</p>

							<p>"I have a great mind to take to you all, to make a fuss
								about you, and to show the others how badly they behave."</p>

							<p>"You'd be a queen amongst us; there's no doubt about
								that."</p>

							<p>"It would be lovely, and it would be a tremendous bit of
								naughtiness," thought Kathleen.</p>

							<p>"Do you think you will, miss? Because, if you do, I will
								tell the others. We could meet you and talk over things."</p>

							<p>"Well, I will decide to-morrow. I will enclose a letter
								with your brooch. Good-bye now; I must go in and kiss my darling
								Ruth."</p>

							<p>Susy Hopkins stood for a minute to watch Kathleen as she
								went up the little narrow path of Sans Souci. When Kathleen
								reached the porch she waved her hand, and Susy, putting wings to
								her feet, ran as fast as she could in the opposite direction.
								She felt very much elated and really pleased. In the whole
								course of her life she had never met a girl of the Kathleen
								O'Hara type before. Her beauty, her daring and wild manner, the
								flash in her bright dark eyes, the glints of gold in her lovely
								hair, all fascinated Susy.</p>

							<p>"What a queen she'd make!" she thought. "We must make her
								our queen. We'd have quite a party of our own in the school if
								she took us up. And she will; I'm sure she will. This is a lark.
								This is worth a great deal."</p>

							<p>Meanwhile Kathleen rang the bell at Sans Souci in a very
								smart, imperative manner. A little maid, neatly dressed, came to
								the door.</p>

							<p>
								"Please," said Kathleen, "will you say that Miss O'Hara
								<!-- Page 45 -->
								<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a> has called and would be glad
								to see Miss Ruth Craven for a few minutes?"
							</p>

							<p>The girl withdrew. Presently she returned.</p>

							<p>"Mrs. Weldon will be pleased if you will go in, miss. She
								is sitting in the drawing-room. The two young ladies are out in
								the garden."</p>

							<p>"Thank you," said Kathleen.</p>

							<p>After a brief hesitation she entered the house, and was
								conducted across the narrow hall into a very sweet and
								charmingly furnished room. The room had a bay-window with French
								doors; these opened on to a little flower-lawn. At one side of
								the house was a tiny conservatory full of bright flowers.
								Compared to the house where the Tennants lived, this tiny place
								looked like a paradise to Kathleen. She gave a quick glance
								round her, then came up to Mrs. Weldon.</p>

							<p>"I am one of the new girls at the Great Shirley School,"
								she said. "My name is Kathleen O'Hara. I am Irish. I have only
								just crossed the cold sea. I am lonely, too. I want Ruth Craven.
								May I sit down a minute while your servant fetches her? I like
								Ruth Craven. She is very pretty, isn't she? She is the sort of
								girl that you'd take a fancy to when you're lonely and far from
								home. May I sit here until she comes?"</p>

							<p>"Of course, my dear," said Mrs. Weldon, speaking with
								kindness, and looking with eyes full of interest at the
								handsome, striking-looking girl. "I quite understand your being
								lonely. I was very lonely indeed when I came home from India and
								left my dear father and mother behind me."</p>

							<p>"How old were you when you came home?"</p>

							<p>
								"A great deal younger than you are: only seven years old. But
								that is a long time ago. I should like to be kind
								<!-- Page 46 -->
								<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a> to you, Miss O'Hara.
								Cassandra has been telling me about you. You are living at the
								Tennants', are you not? Alice Tennant and Cassandra are great
								friends."
							</p>

							<p>"But I don't like either of them," said Kathleen in her
								blunt way.</p>

							<p>Mrs. Weldon looked a little startled.</p>

							<p>"Do you know my daughter?" she asked.</p>

							<p>"She is much too interfering, and she is frightfully
								stuck-up. Please forgive me, but I am always very plain-spoken;
								I always tell the truth. I don't want her. I like you, and wish
								that I lived with you, and that you'd have Ruth Craven instead
								of your own daughter in the house. Then I'd be perfectly happy.
								I always did say what I thought. Will you forgive me?"</p>

							<p>"I will, dear, because at the present moment you don't
								know my girl at all. There never was a more splendid girl in all
								the world, but she requires to be known. Ah! here she comes, and
								your little friend, Miss Craven, with her."</p>

							<p>Ruth, looking very pretty, with a delicate flush on each
								cheek, now entered the room in the company of Cassandra.
								Kathleen sprang up the minute she saw Ruth, rushed across the
								room, and flung one arm with considerable violence round her
								neck.</p>

							<p>
								"You have come," she said. "I have been hunting the place for
								you. How dared you go away and hide yourself? Don't you know
								that you belong to me? The moment I saw you I knew that you were
								my affinity. Don't you know what an affinity means? Well, you
								are mine. We were twin souls before birth; now we have met again
								and we cannot part. I am ever so happy when I am with you. Don't
								mind those others; let them stare all they like. I am going to
								take you foundation girls up. I have made
								<!-- Page 47 -->
								<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a> up my mind. We will have a
								rollicking good time—a splendid time. We will be as naughty as
								we like, and we will let the others see what we are made of. It
								will be war to the knife between the foundation girls and the
								good, proper, paying girls. Let the ladies look after
								themselves. We of the foundation will lead our own life, and be
								as happy as the day is long. Aren't you glad to see me, dear,
								sweet, pretty Ruth? Don't you know for yourself that you are my
								affinity—my chosen friend, my beloved? Through the ages we have
								been one, and now we have met in the flesh."
							</p>

							<p>"I think," said Cassandra, at last managing to get herself
								heard, "that you have said enough for the present, Miss O'Hara.
								Ruth Craven has come to spend the day with me. I know that you
								are an Irish girl, and you must be lonely. I shall be very
								pleased if you will join Ruth and me in our walk. We are going
								for a walk across the common.—We shall be in to tea, dear
								mother. Will you have it ready for us not later than five
								o'clock? And I am sure you will join me, mother darling, in
								asking Miss O'Hara to stay, too."</p>

							<p>"But Miss O'Hara doesn't want to join either you or your
								'mother darling,'" said Kathleen in her rudest tone. "It is Ruth
								I want. I have come here for her. She must return with me at
								once."</p>

							<p>"But I can't. I am ever so sorry, Miss O'Hara."</p>

							<p>"You mean that you won't come when I have called for you?"</p>

							<p>"I am with Miss Weldon at present."</p>

							<p>
								"Be sensible, dear," said Mrs. Weldon at that moment. "You don't
								quite understand our manners in this country. However attached
								we may be to a person, we don't enter a strange house and snatch
								that person out of it. It
								<!-- Page 48 -->
								<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a> isn't our way; and I don't
								think—you will forgive me for saying it—that your way is as nice
								as ours. Be persuaded, dear, and join Cassandra and Ruth, and
								have a happy time."
							</p>

							<p>Kathleen's face had turned crimson. She looked from Mrs.
								Weldon to Cassandra, and then she looked at Ruth. Suddenly her
								eyes brimmed up with tears.</p>

							<p>"I don't think I can ever change my way," she said. "I am
								sorry if I am rude and not understood. Perhaps, after all, I am
								mistaken, about Ruth; perhaps she is not my real proper
								affinity. I am a very unhappy girl. I wish I could go back to
								mother and to my dad. I shouldn't be lonely if I were in the
								midst of the mountains, and if I could see the streams and the
								blue sea. I don't know why Aunt Katie O'Flynn sent me to this
								horrid place. I wish I was back in the old country. They don't
								talk as you talk in the old country and they don't look as you
								look. If you put your heart at the feet of a body in old
								Ireland, that body doesn't kick it away. I will go. I don't want
								your tea. I don't want anything that you have to offer me. I
								don't like any of you. I am sorry if you think me rude, but I
								can't help myself. Good-bye."</p>

							<p>"No, no; stay. Stay and visit with me, and tell me about
								the old country and the sea and the mountains," said Mrs.
								Weldon.</p>

							<p>But Kathleen shook her head fiercely, and the next moment
								left the room.</p>

							<p>"Poor, strange little girl," thought the good woman. "I
								see she is about to heap unhappiness on herself and others. What
								is to be done for her?"</p>

							<p>"I like her," said Ruth. "She is very impulsive, but she
								is———"</p>

							<p>
								"Oh, yes," said Cassandra, "she has a good heart, of
								<!-- Page 49 -->
								<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a> course; but I foresee that
								she is up to all sorts of mischief. She doesn't understand our
								ways. Why did she leave her own country?"
							</p>

							<p>Ruth was silent. She looked wistful.</p>

							<p>"Come along, Ruthie; we will be late. I have no end of
								schemes in my head. I mean to help you. You will win that
								scholarship."</p>

							<p>Ruth smiled. Presently she and Cassandra were crossing the
								common arm-in-arm. In the interest of their own conversation
								they forgot Kathleen.</p>

							<p>When that young lady left the house she ran back to the
								Tennants'.</p>

							<p>"I will write to dad to-night and tell him that I can't
								stay," she thought. "Oh, dear, my heart is in my mouth! I shall
								have a broken heart if this sort of thing goes on."</p>

							<p>She entered the house. There sat Mrs. Tennant with a great
								basket of stockings before her. The remains of a rough-looking
								tea were on the table. The boys had disappeared.</p>

							<p>"Come in, Kathleen," called Mrs. Tennant, "and have your
								tea. I want Maria to clear the tea-things away, as I have some
								cutting out to do; so be quick, dear."</p>

							<p>Kathleen entered. The untidy table did not trouble her in
								the least; she was accustomed to things of that sort at home.
								She sat down, helped herself to a thick slice of
								bread-and-butter, and ate it, while burning thoughts filled her
								mind.</p>

							<p>"Have some tea. You haven't touched any," said Mrs.
								Tennant.</p>

							<p>"I'd rather have cold water, please," Kathleen replied.</p>

							<p>She went to the sideboard, filled a glass, and drank it
								off.</p>

							<p>
								"Mrs. Tennant," she said when she had finished, "what
								<!-- Page 50 -->
								<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a> possessed you to live in
								England? You had all the world to choose from. Why did you come
								to a horrible place like this?"
							</p>

							<p>"But I like it," said Mrs. Tennant.</p>

							<p>"You don't look as if you did. I never saw such a worn-out
								poor body. Are you awfully old?"</p>

							<p>"You would think me so," replied Mrs. Tennant, with a
								smile; "but as a matter of fact I am not forty yet."</p>

							<p>"Not forty!" said Kathleen. "But forty's an awful age,
								isn't it? I mean, you want crutches when you are forty, don't
								you?"</p>

							<p>"Not as a rule, my dear. I trust when I am forty I shall
								not want a crutch. I shall be forty in two years, and that by
								some people is considered young."</p>

							<p>"Then I suppose it is mending those horrid stockings that
								makes you so old."</p>

							<p>"Mending stockings doesn't help to keep you young,
								certainly."</p>

							<p>"Shall I help you? I used to cobble for old nurse when I
								was at home."</p>

							<p>"But I shouldn't like you to cobble these."</p>

							<p>"Oh, I can darn, you know."</p>

							<p>"Then do, Kathleen. I should take it very kindly if you
								would. Here is worsted, and here is a needle. Will you sit by me
								and tell me about your home?"</p>

							<p>
								Kathleen certainly would not have believed her own ears had she
								been told an hour ago that she would end her first fit of
								desperate naughtiness by darning stockings for the Tennant boys.
								She did not darn well; but then, Mrs. Tennant was not
								particular. She certainly—although she said she would not—did
								cobble these stockings to an extraordinary extent; but her work
								and the chat with
								<!-- Page 51 -->
								<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a> Mrs. Tennant did her good,
								and she went upstairs to dress for supper in a happier frame of
								mind.
							</p>

							<p>"I will stay here for a little," she said finally to Mrs.
								Tennant, "because I think it will help you. You look so terribly
								tired; and I don't think you ought to have this horrible work to
								do. I'd like to do it for you, but I don't suppose I shall have
								time. I will stay for a bit and see what I can make of the
								foundation girls."</p>

							<p>"The foundation girls?"</p>

							<p>"Oh, yes; don't ask me to explain. There are a hundred of
								them at the Great Shirley School, and I am going—No, I can't
								explain. I will stop here instead of running away. I meant to
								run away when my affinity would have nothing to do with me."</p>

							<p>"Really, Kathleen, you are a most extraordinary girl."</p>

							<p>
								"Of course I am," said Kathleen. "Did you ever suppose that I
								was anything else? I am very remarkable, and I am very naughty.
								I always was, and I always will be. I am up to no end of
								mischief. I wish you could have seen me and Rory together at
								home. Oh, what didn't we do? Do you know that once we walked
								across a little bridge of metal which is put between two of the
								stables? It is just a narrow iron rod, six feet in length. If we
								had either of us fallen we'd have been dashed to pieces on the
								cobble-stones forty feet below. Mother saw me when I was
								half-way across, and she gave a shriek. It nearly finished me,
								but I steadied myself and got across. Oh, it was jolly! I am
								going to set some of the foundation girls at that sort of thing.
								I expect I shall have great fun with them. It is principally
								because my affinity won't have anything to do with me; she is
								attaching herself to another, and that other is little better
								than a monster. Your Alice won't like me; and, to be frank with
								you, I don't
								<!-- Page 52 -->
								<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a> like her. I like you,
								because you are poor and worried and seem old for your
								age—although your age is a great one—and because you have to
								cobble those horrid socks. There! good-bye for the present.
								Don't hate me too much; I can't help the way I am made. Oh; I
								hear Alice. What a detestable voice she has! Now then, I'm off."
							</p>

							<p>Kathleen ran up to her room, and again she locked the
								door. She heard Alice's step, and she felt a certain
								vindictiveness as she turned the key in the lock. Alice
								presently took the handle of the door and shook it.</p>

							<p>"Let me in at once, Kathleen," she said. "I really can't
								put up with this sort of thing any longer. I want to get into my
								room; I want to tidy myself. I am going to supper to-night with
								Cassandra Weldon."</p>

							<p>"Then you don't get in," whispered Kathleen to herself.
								Aloud she said:</p>

							<p>"I am sorry, darling, but I am specially busy, and I
								really must have my share of the room to myself."</p>

							<p>"Do open the door, Kathleen," now almost pleaded poor
								Alice. "If you want your share of the room, I want mine. Don't
								you understand?"</p>

							<p>"I am not interfering, dearest," called back Kathleen,
								"and I am keeping religiously to my own half. I have the
								straight window, and you have the bay. I am not touching your
								beautiful half; I am only in mine."</p>

							<p>"Let me in," called Alice again, "and don't be silly."</p>

							<p>"Sorry, dear; don't think I am silly."</p>

							<p>
								There was a silence. Alice went on her knees and peered through
								the keyhole: Kathleen was seated by her dressing-table, and
								there was a sound of the furious scratching of a pen quite
								audible. "This is intolerable," thought Alice. "She is the most
								awful girl I ever heard of. I shall be late. Mary Addersley and
								Rhoda Pierpont are to call for
								<!-- Page 53 -->
								<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a> me shortly, and I shan't be
								ready. I don't want to appeal to mother or to be rude to the
								poor wild thing the first day. Stay, I will tempt
								her.—Kathleen!"
							</p>

							<p>"Yes, darling."</p>

							<p>"Wouldn't you like to come with me to Cassandra Weldon's?
								She is so nice, and so is her mother. She plays beautifully, and
								they will sing."</p>

							<p>"Irish songs?" called out Kathleen.</p>

							<p>"I don't know. Perhaps they will if you ask them."</p>

							<p>"Thanks," replied Kathleen; "I am not going." Again there
								was silence, and the scratching of the pen continued. Alice was
								now obliged to go downstairs to acquaint her mother.</p>

							<p>"What is it, dear? Why, my dear Alice, how excited you
								look!"</p>

							<p>"I have cause to be, mother. I have come in rather late,
								very much fagged out from a day of hard examination work and
								that imp—that horrid girl—has locked me out of my bedroom. I was
								so looking forward to a nice little supper with Cassandra and
								the other girls! Kathleen won't let me in; she really is
								intolerable. I can't stay in the room with her any longer; she
								is past bearing. Can't you give me an attic to myself at the top
								of the house?"</p>

							<p>"You know I haven't a corner."</p>

							<p>"Can't I share your bed, mummy? I shall be so miserable
								with that dreadful Kathleen."</p>

							<p>"You know quite well, Alice, that that is the only really
								good bedroom in the house, and I can't afford to give it to one
								girl by herself. I think Kathleen will be all right when we
								really get to know her; but she is very undisciplined. Still,
								three guineas a week makes an immense difference to me, Alice. I
								can't help telling you so, my child."</p>

							<p>
								<!-- Page 54 -->
								<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>"In my opinion, it is hardly
								earned," said Alice. "I suppose I must stay down here and give
								up my supper. I can't go like this, all untidy, and my hair so
								messy, and my collar—oh, mother, it is nearly black! It is
								really too trying."
							</p>

							<p>"I will go up and see if I can persuade her," said Mrs.
								Tennant.</p>

							<p>She went upstairs, turned the handle of the door, and
								spoke. The moment her voice penetrated to Kathleen's ears, she
								jumped to her feet, crossed the room, and bent down at the other
								side of the keyhole.</p>

							<p>"Don't tire your dear voice," she said. "What is it you
								want?"</p>

							<p>"I want you to open the door, Kathleen. Poor Alice wants
								to get in to get her clothes. It is her room as much as yours.
								Let her in at once, my dear."</p>

							<p>"I am very sorry, darling Mrs. Tennant, but I am privately
								engaged in my own half of the room. I am not interfering with
								Alice's."</p>

							<p>"But you see, Kathleen, she can't get to her half."</p>

							<p>"The door is in my half, you know," said Kathleen very
								meekly, "so I don't see that she has any cause to complain. I am
								awfully sorry; I will be as quick as I can."</p>

							<p>"You annoy me very much. You make me very uncomfortable by
								going on in this extremely silly way, Kathleen."</p>

							<p>"I will darn some more socks for you, darling, tired pet,"
								whispered Kathleen coaxingly. "I really am awfully sorry, but
								there is no help for it. I must finish my own private affairs in
								my own half of the room."</p>

							<p>She retreated from the door, and the scratching of the pen
								continued.</p>

							<p>
								<!-- Page 55 -->
								<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>Alice downstairs felt like a
								caged lion. Mrs. Tennant admitted that Kathleen's conduct was
								very bad.
							</p>

							<p>"It won't happen again, Alice," she said, "for I shall
								remove the key from the lock. She won't shut you out another
								time. Make the best of it, darling. If we don't worry her too
								much she is sure to capitulate."</p>

							<p>"Not she. She is a perfect horror," said Alice.</p>

							<p>Mrs. Weldon's supper party was to begin at eight o'clock.
								It was now seven, and the girls were to call for Alice at
								half-past. If Kathleen would only be quick she might still have
								time.</p>

							<p>The boys came in. They stared open-eyed at Alice when they
								saw her still sitting in her rough school things, a very cross
								expression on her face. David came up to her at once; he was the
								favorite, and people said he had a way with him. Whatever they
								meant by that, most people did what David Tennant liked. He
								stood in front of his sister now and said:</p>

							<p>"What's the matter? And where's the little Irish beauty?"</p>

							<p>"For goodness' sake don't speak about her," said Alice.
								"She's driving me nearly mad."</p>

							<p>"Your sister is naturally much annoyed, David," said his
								mother. "Kathleen is evidently a very tiresome girl. She has
								locked the door of their mutual bedroom, and declines to open
								it; she says that as the door happens to be in her half of the
								room, she has perfect control over it."</p>

							<p>David whistled. Ben burst out laughing.</p>

							<p>"Well, now that is Irish," David said.</p>

							<p>"If you take her part I shall hate you all the rest of my
								life," said Alice, speaking with great passion.</p>

							<p>
								"But can't you wait just for once?" asked David. "Any
								<!-- Page 56 -->
								<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a> one could tell she is just
								trying it on. She'll get tired of sitting there by herself if
								only you have patience."
							</p>

							<p>"But I am due at Cassandra's for supper" and Mary
								Addersley and Rhoda Pierpont are to call for me at half-past
								seven."</p>

							<p>"Oh, that's it, is it?" said David.—"Ben, leave off
								teasing." For Ben was whistling and jumping about, and making
								the most expressive faces at poor Alice,—"I will see what I can
								do," he said, and he ran upstairs. David was very musical;
								indeed, the soul of music dwelt in his eyes, in his voice, in
								his very step. He might in some respects have been an Irish boy
								himself. He bent down now and whistled very softly, and in the
								most flute-like manner, "Garry Owen" through the keyhole. There
								was a restless sound in the room, and then a cross voice said:</p>

							<p>"Go away."</p>

							<p>David stopped whistling "Garry Owen," and proceeded to
								execute a most exquisite performance of "St. Patrick's Day in
								the Morning." Kathleen trembled. Her eyes filled with tears.
								David was now whistling right into her room "The Wearing of the
								Green." Kathleen flung down her pen, making a splash on the
								paper.</p>

							<p>"Go away," she called out. "What are you doing there?"</p>

							<p>"The outside of this door doesn't belong to you," called
								David, "and if I like to whistle through the keyhole you can't
								prevent me;" and he began "Garry Owen" again.</p>

							<p>Kathleen rushed to the door and flung it open. The tears
								were still wet on her cheeks.</p>

							<p>"Can't you guess what you are doing?" she said. "You are
								stabbing me—stabbing me. Oh! oh! oh!" and she burst into violent
								sobs. David took her hand.</p>

							<p>
								"Come, little Irish colleen," he said. "Come along downstairs. I
								am going to be chummy with you. Don't be so
								<!-- Page 57 -->
								<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a> lonely. Give Alice her room;
								one-half of it is hers, and she wants to dress to go out."
							</p>

							<p>"Let her take it all," sobbed Kathleen. "I am most
								miserable. Oh, Garry Owen, Garry Owen! Oh, Land of the Shamrock!
								Oh, my broken heart!"</p>

							<p>She laid her head on David's shoulder and went on sobbing.
								David felt quite bashful. There was nothing for it but to take
								out his big and not too clean handkerchief and wipe her tears
								away.</p>

							<p>"Whisper," he said in her ear. "There are stables at the
								back of the house; they are old, worn-out stables. There is a
								loft over one, and I keep apples and nuts there. It's the
								jolliest place. Will you and I go there for an hour or two after
								supper?"</p>

							<p>"Do you mean it?" said Kathleen, her eyes filling with
								laughter, and the tears still wet on her cheeks.</p>

							<p>"Yes, colleen, I mean it, for I want you to tell me all
								you can about your land of the shamrock."</p>

							<p>"Why, then, that I will," she replied. "Wisha, then,
								David, it's a broth of a boy, you are!" and she kissed him on
								his forehead. David took her hand and led her into the
								dining-room. Alice was still there, looking more stormy than
								ever.</p>

							<p>"It's too late now," she said; "the girls have come and
								gone. I can't go at all now."</p>

							<p>"But why, darling?" said Kathleen. "Oh! I wish I had let
								you in.—She must go, David, the poor dear. It would be cruel to
								disappoint her.—What dress will you wear?" said Kathleen.</p>

							<p>"Let me alone," said Alice.</p>

							<p>She rushed upstairs, but Kathleen was even quicker.</p>

							<p>
								"I'm not going to be nasty to you any more," she said. "I have
								found a friend, and I shall have more friends to
								<!-- Page 58 -->
								<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>morrow. Kathleen O'Hara would
								have died long ago but for her friends. I shall be happy when I
								have got a creelful of them here. Now then, let me help you. No,
								that isn't the shoe you want; here it is. And gloves—here's a
								pair, and they're neatly mended. Which hat did you say—the one
								with the blue scarf round it? Isn't it a pretty one? You put
								that on. Aunt Katie O'Flynn is going to send me a box of clothes
								from Dublin, and I will give you some of them. You mustn't say
								no; I will give you some if you are nice. I am ever so sorry
								that I kept you out of your part of the room; I won't do it any
								more. Now you are dressed; that's fine. You won't hate me
								forever, will you?"
							</p>

							<p>Alice growled something in reply. She had not Kathleen's
								passionate, quick, impulsive nature—furious with rage one
								minute, sweet and gentle and affectionate the next. She hated
								Kathleen for having humiliated and annoyed her; and she went off
								to Cassandra's house knowing that she would be late, and
								determined not to say one good word for Kathleen.</p>

								<h3>WIT AND GENIUS: THE PLAN PROPOUNDED.</h3>


								<p>While Kathleen was locked in Alice's room, she was
									writing to her father:</p>

								<div class="blockquot">
									<p>
										"<span class="smcap">My Darling Daddy</span>.—If ever there
										was a cold, dreary, abominable land, it is this where they
										wave the British flag. The ugliness of it would make you sick.
										The people are as ugly as the country, and they're so stiff
										and stuck-u
										<!-- Page 59 -->
										<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>p. If you suppose for a
										moment that your wild Irish girl can stand much of this sort
										of thing, you are fine and mistaken, and you can tell the
										mother so. I mean to write to Aunt Katie O'Flynn to-morrow and
										give her a fine piece of my mind. Early in the day, dad, I did
										not think that I could stay at all; but I have got a plan in
										my head now, and if I succeed I may at least put up with one
										term of this detestable school. I won't tell you the plan, for
										you mightn't approve; in fact, I can guess in advance that you
										wouldn't approve. Anyhow, it is going to occupy the time and
										thoughts of your Kathleen. Now I want a good bit of money; not
										a pound or even five pounds, but more than that. Can you send
										me a ten-pound note, daddy mine, and say nothing whatever
										about it to the mother or the retainers at Carrigrohane? And
										can you let me have it as quick as quick can be? Maybe I will
										want more before the term is up, or maybe I won't. Anyhow, we
										will let that lie in the future. Oh, my broth of an old dad,
										wouldn't I like to hug you this blessed minute? How is
										everybody at home? How are the mountains? How is the sea? How
										is the trout-stream? Are those young cousins of mine behaving
										themselves, the spalpeens? And how are you, my heart of
										hearts—missing your Kathleen, I doubt not? Well, no more for
										the present. They're rattling at the door like anything, and
										there's a detestable boy now whistling 'Garry Owen' right into
										my heart. You can't imagine what I am feeling. Oh, the
										omadhaun! he is changing it now into 'St. Patrick's Day,'
										Wisha, then, daddy! I must stop, for it's more than the heart
										of woman can stand. Your affectionate daughter,
									</p>

									<p>
										"<span class="smcap">Kathleen</span>."

								</div>

								<p>
									This letter was posted by Kathleen herself. After sup
									<!-- Page 60 -->
									<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>per she went with David into
									the old loft over the tumble-down stables. It was not a very
									safe place of refuge, for the rafters were rotten and might
									tumble down at any time. Still, the sense of danger made it
									all, the more interesting to the children. There they sat side
									by side, and Kathleen told David about her old life. She was
									very outspoken and affectionate, and very fierce and very wild.
									To look at her, one would have said there never was any one
									less reserved; but Kathleen in her heart of hearts was
									intensely reserved. Her real feelings she never told; her real
									hopes she never breathed. She talked with high spirits all the
									time; and although she liked David and was much comforted by
									his words and his actions, he did not get at the real Kathleen
									at all.
								</p>

								<p>When Alice came back that evening Kathleen was sound
									asleep in her little bed, dreaming of Carrigrohane and the old
									home. She was murmuring some loving words as Alice entered the
									room.</p>

								<p>"Oh, daddy mine, my heart is sore for you," she was
									saying in a tone which caused Alice to pause and look at her
									attentively.</p>

								<p>"She is the most awful girl I ever heard of," thought
									Alice. "I am sure she will get us into trouble. I know that
									those three guineas a week that mother gets for having her are
									not worth all the mischief she will drag us into. But still,
									she does look pretty when she is asleep."</p>

								<p>
									Kathleen had very long and very thick eyelashes and nobly
									arched brows. Her forehead was broad and full and beautifully
									white. The mischievous, dare-devil expression of her face when
									awake was softened in her sleep. Alice, who had determined to
									come very noisily into the room and bang her things about, to
									take rude possession of her own half of the room—which, after
									all, was the better half—
									<!-- Page 61 -->
									<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>was softened by the look on
									the girl's face. She knelt for a moment at her bedside and
									prayed that God would keep her from quite hating Kathleen. This
									was a great deal from Alice, who had made up her mind never to
									be friends with the Irish girl. Then she got into bed and fell
									asleep.
								</p>

								<p>The next morning, quite early, Kathleen was up. She was
									accustomed to getting up almost at cock-crow at Carrigrohane,
									and when Alice opened her eyes, it was to see an empty bed and
									an empty room.</p>

								<p>"I wonder if she's up to mischief?" she thought.</p>

								<p>She got up and went to the window. Kathleen was walking
									across the common. She had no hat on, and no jacket. She was
									stepping along leisurely, looking up sometimes at the sky, and
									sometimes pausing as though she was thinking hard.</p>

								<p>"She will catch cold and be ill; that will be the next
									trouble," thought the indignant Alice. She sleepily proceeded
									with her dressing. It was only half-past seven. The Great
									Shirley School met at nine. Alice was seldom downstairs until
									past eight. When she came down this morning she saw, to her
									amazement, Kathleen helping the very untidy maid-of-all-work to
									lay the breakfast things. She was dashing about, putting plates
									and cups and saucers anyhow upon the board.</p>

								<p>"Now then, Maria," she said, "shall I run down to the
									kitchen and bring up the hot bacon and the porridge? I will,
									with a heart and a half. Oh, you poor girl, how tired you
									look!"</p>

								<p>Maria, whom Alice never noticed, looked with adoring eyes
									at beautiful Kathleen.</p>

								<p>"It isn't right, miss. I ought to be doing my own work,"
									she said. "I am ever so much obliged to you, miss."</p>

								<p>
									<!-- Page 62 -->
									<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>"Wisha, then, it is I who
									like to help you," said Kathleen, "for you look fair beat."
								</p>

								<p>She dashed past Alice, and appeared the next moment in
									the kitchen.</p>

								<p>"Where's the bacon, cook? And where's the bread, and
									where's the butter, and all the rest of the breakfast? See,
									woman—see! Give me a tray and I will fill it up and take the
									things upstairs with my own hands. You think it is beneath me,
									perhaps; but I am a lady from a castle, and at Carrigrohane
									Castle we often do this sort of thing when the hands of the
									poor maids are full to overflowing."</p>

								<p>The cook, a sandy-haired and sour-looking woman, began by
									scowling at Kathleen; but soon the girl's pretty face and merry
									eyes appeased her. She and Kathleen had almost a quarrel as to
									who was to carry up the tray, but Kathleen won the day; and
									when Mrs. Tennant made her appearance, feeling tired and
									overdone, she was amazed to see Kathleen acting parlor-maid.</p>

								<p>"I love it," she said. "If I can help you, you dear,
									tired, worn one, I shall be only too glad."</p>

								<p>"I am sure, mother," said Alice, "it is very good of
									Kathleen to wish to do the household work; but as she has been
									sent here to gain some information of another sort, do you
									think it ought to be allowed?"</p>

								<p>"And who will prevent it, darling? That is the question,"
									said Kathleen in her softest voice.</p>

								<p>Alice was silent.</p>

								<p>
									"I tell you what," said Kathleen. "When I see you beginning to
									help your poor, exhausted mother, and running messages for that
									overworked slavey—I think you call her Maria—then perhaps I'll
									do less. And when there's some one else to mend the boys'
									socks, perhaps I won't
									<!-- Page 63 -->
									<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a> offer; but until there is,
									the less you say about such things the better, Miss Alice
									Tennant."
								</p>

								<p>Ben kicked David under the table, and David kicked him
									back to stay quiet. Altogether the breakfast was a noisy one.</p>

								<p>Kathleen went to school quite prepared to carry out her
									promise to Susy Hopkins. She had neatly packed the little Irish
									diamond brooch in a box, and had slipped under it a tiny note:</p>

								<div class="blockquot">
									<p>
										"Get as many foundation girls as you can to meet me, at
										whatever place you like to appoint, this evening. I have a
										plan to propose.—<span class="smcap">Kathleen O'Hara</span>.
									</p>

									<p>
										<i>"P.S.</i>—You can name the place by pinning a note under my
										desk. Be sure you all come. The plan is gloryious."
									</p>
								</div>

								<p>The thought of the note and the plan and the little
									brooch kept Kathleen in a fairly good humor on her walk to
									school. There she saw Ruth Craven. She was decidedly angry with
									Ruth for having, as she said to herself, "snubbed her" the day
									before. But beauty always had a curious effect on the Irish
									girl, and when she observed Ruth's really exquisite little
									face, clear cut as a cameo, with eyes full of expression, and
									watched the lips ready to break into the gentlest smiles,
									Kathleen said to herself:</p>

								<p>"It is all over with me. She is the only decent-looking
									colleen I have met in this God-forsaken country. Make up to her
									I will."</p>

								<p>She dashed, therefore, almost rudely through a great mass
									of incoming girls, and seized Ruth by her shoulder.</p>

								<p>
									"Ruth," she said, "go and talk to Susy Hopkins during
									<!-- Page 64 -->
									<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a> recess. She will have
									something to say, and I want you so badly. You won't refuse me,
									will you, Ruth?"
								</p>

								<p>"But I don't know what you want," said Ruth.</p>

								<p>"Go and talk to Susy Hopkins; she will know. Oh, there
									she is!"</p>

								<p>"Kathleen, Kathleen!" called out Alice. "The school-bell
									has just rung, and they are opening the doors. Come do come."</p>

								<p>"In a jiff," replied Kathleen.</p>

								<p>She ran up to Susy.</p>

								<p>"This is what I promised," she said; "and there is a note
									inside. Read it, and give me the answer where I have asked
									you."</p>

								<p>Susy Hopkins, a most ordinary little girl, who had no
									position of any sort in the school, colored high with delight.
									Some of the paying girls looked at her in astonishment. Susy
									walked into the school with her head high in the air; she quite
									adored Kathleen, for she was making her a person of great
									distinction.</p>

								<p>"We are going to have a glorious time," whispered Susy to
									Kate Rourke as they made their way to their respective classes.</p>

								<p>Susy was small, rather stupid, and absolutely
									unimportant. Kate was big, black-eyed, impudent. She was
									jealous of the paying girls of the school; but she treated Susy
									as some one beneath contempt.</p>

								<p>"Don't drag my sleeve," she replied crossly. "And what
									you do mean by a glorious time? I don't understand you."</p>

								<p>
									"You will presently," said Susy. "And when all is said and
									done, you will have to remember that you owe it to me. But I
									have no time to talk now; only meet me, and bring as many of
									the foundationers as you can collect into
									<!-- Page 65 -->
									<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a> the left-hand corner of the
									playground, just behind the Botanical Laboratory, at recess."
								</p>

								<p>Kate made no answer, unless a toss of her head could have
									been taken as a reply. Her first impulse was to take no notice
									of Susy's remarks—little Susy Hopkins, the daughter of a small
									stationer in the town, a girl who had scarcely scraped through
									in her examination. It was intolerable that she should put on
									such airs.</p>

								<p>The work of the school began, and all the girls were
									busy. Kate was clever, and she meant to try for one of the big
									scholarships. She would get her forty pounds a year when the
									time came, and go to Holloway College or some other college.
									She was not a lady by birth; she had not a single instinct of a
									true lady within her; but she was intensely ambitious. She did
									not care so much for beauty as for style; she made style her
									idol. The look that Cassandra wore as she walked quietly across
									the room, the set of her dress, the still more wonderful set of
									her head as it was placed on her queenly young shoulders—these
									were the things that burnt into Kate's soul and made her
									restless and dissatisfied. She would willingly have given all
									her father's wealth—and he was quite well-to-do for his class—-
									to have Cassandra's face, Cassandra's voice, Cassandra's
									figure. Cassandra was not at all a pretty girl, but her
									appearance appealed to all the wild ambitions in Kate's soul.
									She had a jealous contempt of Ruth Craven, who, although a
									foundation girl, managed to look like a lady; but her envy was
									centered round Cassandra. As to the Irish girl, she had
									scarcely noticed her up to the present.</p>

								<p>
									Work went on that morning with much verve and vigor. It was a
									pleasant morning: the windows were open; the schoolrooms were
									all well ventilated; the teachers, the best of their kind, were
									stimulating in their lectures and
									<!-- Page 66 -->
									<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a> in their conversation.
									There was a look of business and animation throughout the whole
									place: it was like a hive of bees. At last the moment of recess
									arrived. Kate just raised her head, looked over the shoulders
									of her companions, and saw Susy Hopkins darting restlessly
									about, catching one girl by the sleeve, another by the arm,
									whispering in the ear of a third, flinging her arm round the
									neck of a fourth; and as she spoke to the girls they looked
									interested, astonished, and cordial. They moved away to that
									lonely part of the playground which was situated at the back of
									the Botanical Laboratory. Kate had made up her mind not to take
									the least notice of Susy. She was pacing up and down alone;
									for, most provoking, all her chosen friends had gone off with
									that young lady. Suddenly she saw Ruth Craven going very
									quietly by. By all the laws of the foundationers, Ruth ought to
									speak to her companions in misfortune. Kate rushed up to her.
								</p>

								<p>"What are they all doing there?" she said. "Do you happen
									to know Susy Hopkins?"</p>

								<p>"No," replied Ruth gently. "She came up to me just now
									and asked me to join her and some other girls at the back of
									the Laboratory. I don't know that I want to."</p>

								<p>"I am curious," said Kate. "Of course, I am no friend of
									Susy's; she is a most contemptible little wretch; but I may as
									well know what it is all about. Come with me, won't you?"</p>

								<p>Ruth hesitated.</p>

								<p>"Come along; we may as well know. There is probably some
									mischief on foot, and it is only fair that we should be
									forewarned."</p>

								<p>"I don't want to know," said Ruth; but as Kate slipped
									her hand through her arm and pulled her along, she said
									resignedly, "Well, if I must I must."</p>

								<p>
									<!-- Page 67 -->
									<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>As they strolled across the
									big playground, Ruth turned and glanced at Cassandra; but
									Cassandra was busy making friends with Florence, who was very
									angry with her for her desertion of the day before, and took no
									notice of Ruth. The Irish girl was nowhere in sight. Ruth
									sighed and continued her walk with Kate.
								</p>

								<p>The most lonely and most dreary part of the playground
									was that little portion which was situated at the back of the
									Laboratory. Nothing grew there; the ground was innocent of
									grass, and much worn by the tramping of young feet. There were
									swings and garden-seats and preparations for tennis and other
									games in the rest of the big playground, but nothing had ever
									been done at the back of the Laboratory. When the two girls
									arrived they found five other girls waiting for them. Their
									names were, of course, Susy Hopkins, who considered herself on
									this delightful occasion quite the leader; a gentle and
									refined-looking girl of the name of Mary Rand; Rosy Myers, who
									was pretty and frivolous, with dark eyes and fair hair; Clara
									Sawyer, who was renowned for her vulgar taste in dress; and
									Hannah Johnson, a heavy-looking girl with a scowling brow and a
									very pronounced jaw. Hannah Johnson was about the plainest girl
									in the school. When Susy saw Kate Rourke and Ruth Craven she
									uttered a little scream of delight.</p>

								<p>
									"Now we are complete," she said. "Listen to me, all you girls,
									for I haven't too long in which to tell you; that horrid bell
									will ring us back to lessons and dullness in less than no time.
									The most wonderful, delightful chance is offered to us. I met
									her yesterday, and she decided to do it. She is a brick of
									bricks. She will make the most tremendous difference in our
									lives. You know, although you pretend not to feel it, but you
									all must know how we
									<!-- Page 68 -->
									<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a> foundationers are sat upon
									and objected to in the school. We bear it as meekly as we can
									for the sake of our so-called advantages; but if we can be
									snubbed, we are, and if we can be neglected, we are—although it
									isn't the teachers we have to complain of, but the girls.
									Sometimes things are past bearing, and yet we are powerless.
									There are three hundred paying girls, and there are one hundred
									foundationers. What chance has one hundred against three?"
								</p>

								<p>"What is the good of bringing all that up, Susy?" said
									Mary Rand. "We are foundationers, and we ought to be thankful."</p>

								<p>"The education is splendid; we ought not to forget that,"
									said Ruth Craven.</p>

								<p>Susy turned on Ruth as though she would like to eat her.</p>

								<p>"It is all very fine for you," she said. "Just because
									you happen to be pretty, they take you up. I wonder one of your
									fine friends doesn't pay for you, and so save your position out
									and out."</p>

								<p>"I wouldn't allow her to," replied Ruth, her eyes
									flashing fire. "I had much rather be a foundationer. I mean to
									prove that I am every bit as good as a paying girl. I mean to
									make you all respect me, so there!"</p>

								<p>"That'll do, Spitfire," said Kate Rourke. "The time is
									passing, and we must get to the bottom of Susy Hopkins's
									remarkable address.—What's up, Susy? What's up?"</p>

								<p>"This," said Susy. "You know the Irish girl who has come
									to live with the Tennants?"</p>

								<p>"Can't say I do," said Kate.</p>

								<p>"Well, you will soon. She's a regular out-and-out
									beauty."</p>

								<p>"I know her," cried Ruth Craven. "She is most lovely."</p>

								<p>
									"She's better," said Susy; "she's bewitching. See; she gave me
									this." Here she pointed proudly to the Irish dia
									<!-- Page 69 -->
									<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>mond brooch, which she had
									stuck in the bosom of her dress. The diamond had been polished,
									and flashed brightly; the silver setting was also as good as
									was to be found. The girls crowded round to admire, and "Oh,
									my!" "Oh, dear!" "Did you ever?" and "Well, I never!" sounded
									on all sides.
								</p>

								<p>"You will be so set up now, Susan Hopkins, that we won't
									be able to bear you in the same class," said Clara Sawyer.</p>

								<p>"Go on," exclaimed Hannah Johnson—"go on and tell us what
									you want. Your horrid brooch doesn't interest us. What have you
									got to say?"</p>

								<p>"You are mad with jealousy, and you know it," answered
									Susy. "Well, I am coming to the great news. The Irish girl's
									name is Kathleen O'Hara, and she comes from a castle over in
									the wild west of Ireland. Her father is very rich, and he keeps
									dogs and horses and carriages and—oh, everything that rich
									people keep. Compared to the other girls in the school, she is
									ten times a lady; and she has a true lady's heart. And she has
									taken a dislike, as far as I can see, to Alice Tennant."</p>

								<p>"And I'm sure I'm not surprised," said Rosy Myers.</p>

								<p>"Stuck-up thing!" said Clara Sawyer.</p>

								<p>"Dirt beneath our feet!" exclaimed Hannah Johnson.</p>

								<p>
									"Well; she doesn't like her either, though she doesn't use that
									kind of language," continued Susy. "Anyhow, she wants to
									befriend <i>us</i>—Oh, do let me speak!"—as Kate interrupted
									with a hasty exclamation. "She thinks that we are just as good
									as herself. There is no false pride about a real lady, girls;
									and the end of it is that she has a plan to propose—something
									for our benefit and for her benefit. See for yourselves; this
									is her letter. It is
									<!-- Page 70 -->
									<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a> in her own beautiful Irish,
									handwriting. You can read it, only don't tear it all to bits."
								</p>

								<p>
									The girls did read the letter. They pressed close together, and
									one peeped over the shoulder of her companion, another stood on
									tiptoe, while a third tried to snatch the letter from the hand
									of her fellow; but all managed to read the words: "Get as many
									foundation girls as you can to meet me, at whatever place you
									like to appoint, this evening. I have a plan to propose." This
									letter and the end of the postscript excited the girls; there
									was no doubt whatever of that. "The plan is <i>gloryious</i>."
									They laughed at the word, smiled into each others' faces, and
									stood very close together consulting.
								</p>

								<p>"The old quarry," whispered Rosy.</p>

								<p>"That's the place!" exclaimed Mary.</p>

								<p>"Let us meet her, we seven by ourselves," was Kate's
									final suggestion. "We will then know what she wants, and if
									there is anything in it. We can form a committee, and get other
									girls to join by degrees. Hurrah! I do say this is fun."</p>

								<p>Susy was now quite petted by her companions. The
									conference hastily ended, and on entering the school Susy
									pinned a piece of paper under Kathleen's desk, on which she
									wrote: "The old quarry; nine o'clock this evening. Will meet
									you at a quarter to nine outside Mrs. Tennant's house."</p>

								<p>
									When Kathleen received the communication her eyes flashed with
									delighted fire. She thrust the letter into her pocket and
									proceeded with her work. The Irish girl looked quite happy that
									day; she had something to interest her at last. Her lessons,
									too, were by no means distasteful. She had a great deal of
									quick wit and ready perception. Hitherto she had been taught
									anyhow, but now she was all
									<!-- Page 71 -->
									<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a> keen to receive real
									instruction. Her intuitions were rapid indeed; she could come
									to startlingly quick conclusions, and as a rule her guesses
									were correct rather than otherwise. Kathleen had a passion for
									music; she had never been properly taught, but the soul of
									music was in her as much as it was in David Tennant. She had a
									beautiful melodious voice, which had, of course, not yet come
									to maturity. Just before the end of the morning she took her
									first lesson in music. Her mistress was a very amiable and
									clever woman of the name of Agnes Spicer. Miss Spicer put a
									sheet of music before her.
								</p>

								<p>"Play that," she said.</p>

								<p>Kathleen frowned. Her delicate white fingers trembled for
									an instant on the keys. She played one or two bars perforce and
									very badly; then she dashed the sheet of music in an impetuous
									way to the floor.</p>

								<p>"I can't," she said; "it isn't my style. May I play you
									something different?"</p>

								<p>Miss Spicer was about to refuse, but looking at the girl,
									whose cheeks were flushed and eyes full of fire, she changed
									her mind.</p>

								<p>"Just this once," she said; "but you must begin to
									practice properly. What I call amateur music can't be allowed
									here."</p>

								<p>"Will this be allowed?" said Kathleen.</p>

								<p>She dashed into heavy chords, played lightly a delicate
									movement, and then broke into an Irish air, "The Harp that once
									through Tara's Halls." From one Irish melody to another her
									light fingers wandered. She played with perfect
									correctness—with fire, with spirit. Soon she forgot herself.
									When she stopped, tears were running down her cheeks.</p>

								<p>
									<!-- Page 72 -->
									<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>"What is music, after all,"
									she said, looking full into the face of her teacher, "when you
									are far from the land you love? How can you stand music then?
									No, I don't mean to learn <i>music</i> at the Great Shirley
									School; I can't. When I am back again at home I shall play 'The
									Harp that once through Tara's Halls,' but I can't do it justice
									here. You will excuse me; I can't. I am sorry if I am rude, but
									it isn't in me. Some time, if you have a headache and feel very
									bad, as my dear father does sometimes, I shall play to you; but
									I can't learn as the other girls learn—it isn't in me."
								</p>

								<p>Again she put her fingers on the keys of the piano and
									brought forth a few sobbing, broken-hearted notes. Then she
									started up.</p>

								<p>"I expect you will punish me for this, Miss Spicer, but I
									am sorry—I can't help myself."</p>

								<p>Strange to say, Miss Spicer did not punish her. On the
									contrary, she took her hand and pressed it.</p>

								<p>"I won't ask you to do any more to-day," she said. "I see
									you are not like others. I will talk the matter over with you
									to-morrow."</p>

								<p>"And you will find me unchanged," said Kathleen. "Thank
									you, all the same, for your forbearance."</p>

									<h3>THE POOR TIRED ONE.</h3>


									<p>
										Mrs. Tennant spent the afternoon out shopping. She told the
										girls at dinner that she would be home for tea, that she
										expected to be rather tired, and hoped that they would be as
										good as possible. The boys were always out
										<!-- Page 73 -->
										<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a> during the afternoon, and
										as a rule never returned until after tea; but Alice and
										Kathleen were expected to be in for this meal. When Mrs.
										Tennant walked down the street, Kathleen went to the window
										and looked after her.
									</p>

									<p>"What are you going to do this afternoon?" said Alice,
										who was lying back in an easy-chair with an open novel in her
										hand.</p>

									<p>"I don't know," replied Kathleen. "What a dull hole this
										is! How can you have grown up and kept well in a place like
										this?"</p>

									<p>"Opinions differ with regard to its dullness," said
										Alice. "I think our home a very pleasant, entertaining place.
										I wouldn't live in your wild castle for all you could give
										me."</p>

									<p>"Nobody asked you, my dear," said Kathleen, with a saucy
										nod of her head.</p>

									<p>She left the room and went up to what she called her
										half of the bedroom on the next floor. She knelt down by the
										window and looked across over the ugly landscape. There were
										houses everywhere—not a scrap of real country, as she
										expressed it, to be found. She took out of her pocket the
										letter which the foundation girls had sent her, and opened and
										read it.</p>

									<p>
										"The old quarry! I wonder where the old quarry is," she
										thought. "It must be a good way from here. We have such a
										place at home, too. I did not suppose one was to be found in
										this horrid part of the world. I am rather glad there is an
										old quarry; it was quite nice of little Susy to suggest it,
										and she will meet me, the little colleen. That is good. What
										fun! I shall probably have to return through the bedroom
										window, so I may as well explore and make all in readiness.
										Dear, dear! I should like David to help me. It isn't the
										naughtiness that I care about, but it is the fun of being
										naughty; it is the fun of
										<!-- Page 74 -->
										<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a> having a sort of dangerous
										thing to do. That is the real joy of it. It is the ecstacy of
										shocking the prim Alice! Oh! there is her step. She's coming
										up, the creature! Now then, I had best be as mum as I can
										unless I want to distract the poor thing entirely."
									</p>

									<p>Alice entered the room.</p>

									<p>"Do you greatly object to shutting the window?" she said
										to Kathleen. "I have a slight cold, and the draught will make
										it worse."</p>

									<p>"Why, then, of course, darling," said Kathleen in a
										hearty voice, as she brought down the window with a bang.
										"Would you like me to shut the ventilator in the grate?" she
										then asked.</p>

									<p>"No. How silly you are!"</p>

									<p>"Is it silly? I thought you had a cold. You are afraid
										of the draughts. Why are you going out?"</p>

									<p>"I want to see a school friend."</p>

									<p>"You will be back in time for tea, won't you?"</p>

									<p>"Can't say."</p>

									<p>"But your mother, the poor tired one, asked you to be
										back."</p>

									<p>"I do wish, Kathleen, that you wouldn't call mother by
										that ridiculous name. She is no more tired than—than other
										women are."</p>

									<p>"If that is the case," said Kathleen, "I heartily hope
										that I shall not live to be a woman. I wouldn't like us all to
										be as fagged as she is—poor, dear, gentle soul! She's
										overworked, and that's the truth."</p>

									<p>Kathleen saw that she was annoying Alice, and proceeded
										with great gusto to expand her theory with regard to Mrs.
										Tennant.</p>

									<p>
										"She's in the condition when she might drop any time," she
										said. "We have had old Irishwomen overworked like
										<!-- Page 75 -->
										<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a> that, and all of a sudden
										they went out like snuffs: that is what happens. What are you
										putting on your best hat for?"
									</p>

									<p>"That is no affair of yours."</p>

									<p>
										"Oh, hoity-toity, how grand we are! Do you know, Alice, you
										haven't got at all nice manners. You think you have, but you
										haven't. We are never rude like that in Ireland. We tell a few
										lies now and then, but they are only <i>polite</i> lies—the
										kind that make other people happy. Alice, I should like to
										know which is best—to be horribly cross, or to tell nice
										polite lies. Which is the most wicked? I should like to know."
									</p>

									<p>"Then I will tell you," said Alice. "What you call a
										nice lie is just a very great and awful sin; and if you don't
										believe me, go to church and listen when the commandments are
										read."</p>

									<p>
										"In future," said Kathleen very calmly, "now that I really
										know your views, I will always tell you <i>home truths</i>.
										You can't blame me, can you?"
									</p>

									<p>Alice deigned no answer. She went downstairs and let
										herself out of the house.</p>

									<p>"And that is the sort of girl I have exchanged for daddy
										and the mother and the boys," thought the Irish girl. "Oh,
										dear! oh, dear!"</p>

									<p>Kathleen flew downstairs. It was nearly three o'clock;
										tea was to be on the table at half-past four. Quick as thought
										she dashed into the kitchen.</p>

									<p>"Maria," she said, "and cook, is there anything nice and
										tasty for tea this evening?"</p>

									<p>"Nice and tasty, miss!" said cook. "And what should
										there be nice and tasty? There's bread, and there's
										butter—Dorset, second-class Dorset—and there's jam (if there's
										any left); and that's about all."</p>

									<p>
										"
										<!-- Page 76 -->
										<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>That sort of tea isn't very
										nourishing, cook, is it? I ask because I want to know," said
										Kathleen.
									</p>

									<p>"It's the kind we always have at Myrtle Lodge," replied
										cook. "I don't hold with it, but then it's the way of the
										missis."</p>

									<p>"I have got some money in my pocket," said Kathleen. "I
										want to have a beautiful, nice tea. Can't you think of
										something to buy? Here's five shillings. Would that get her a
										nice tea?"</p>

									<p>"A nice tea!" cried Maria. "It would get a beautiful
										meal; and the poor missis, she would like it."</p>

									<p>"Then go out, Maria; do, like a darling. I will open the
										door for you if anybody calls. Do run round the corner and
										bring in—Oh! I know what. We'll have sausages—they are
										delicious—and a little tin of sardines—won't they be good?—and
										some water-cress, and some shrimps—oh, yes, shrimps! Be quick!
										And we will put out the best tea-things, and a clean cloth;
										and it will rest the poor tired one so tremendously when she
										comes in and sees a good meal on the table."</p>

									<p>Both cook and Maria were quite excited. Perhaps they had
										an eye to the reversion of the tea, the sausages, the
										sardines, the shrimps, and the water-cress.</p>

									<p>
										Maria went out, and Kathleen stood in the hall. Two or three
										people arrived during Maria's absence, and Kathleen went
										promptly to the door and said, "Not at home, ma'am," in a
										determined voice, and with rather a scowling face, to these
										arrivals. Some of the visitors left rather important messages,
										but Kathleen did not remember them for more than a moment
										after they were delivered. Maria presently came back and the
										tea-table was laid. Kathleen gave Maria sixpence for the
										washing of an extra cloth, and
										<!-- Page 77 -->
										<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a> the well-spread table
										looked quite fresh and wonderfully like a school-feast.
									</p>

									<p>When Mrs. Tennant returned (she came in looking very hot
										and tired), it was to see the room tidy, Kathleen seated in
										her own special chair cobbling the boys' socks as hard as she
										could, and an appetizing tea on the table.</p>

									<p>"What does this mean?" said Mrs. Tennant.</p>

									<p>
										"It means," said Kathleen, jumping up, "that you are to plant
										yourself just here, and you are not to stir. Oh, I know you
										are <i>dead</i> tired. I will take off your shoes, poor dear;
										I have brought your slippers down on purpose, and you are to
										have your tea at this little table. Now what will you have?
										Hot sausages?—They are done to a turn, aren't they, Maria?"
									</p>

									<p>"That they are, miss."</p>

									<p>"A nice hot sausage on toast, and a lovely cup of tea
										with cream in it."</p>

									<p>"But—but," said Mrs. Tennant, "what will Alice say?"</p>

									<p>"Maria and I don't care twopence what Alice says. This
										is my tea, and Maria fetched it. Now then, dear tired one, eat
										and rest."</p>

									<p>Mrs. Tennant looked at Kathleen with loving eyes.</p>

									<p>"Did you buy these things?" she said.</p>

									<p>"That she did, ma'am," cried Maria. "I never did see a
										more thoughtful young lady."</p>

									<p>"My dear child," said Mrs. Tennant, "you are too good."</p>

									<p>Kathleen laughed.</p>

									<p>
										"If there is one thing I am, it is not that," she said. "I am
										not a bit good. I am as wild and naughty and——Oh, but don't
										let us talk about me. I am so hungry. You know I didn't much
										like your dinner to-day. I am not fond of those watery stews.
										Of course, I can eat anything, but I don't specially like
										them; so if you don't mind I
										<!-- Page 78 -->
										<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a> will have a sausage, too,
										and a plateful of shrimps afterwards, and some sardines. And
										isn't this water-cress nice? The leaves are not quite so brown
										as I should like. Oh, we did have such lovely water-cress in
										the stream at home! Mrs. Tennant, you must come back with me
										to Carrigrohane some day, and then you will have a real rest."
									</p>

									<p>Mrs. Tennant, feeling very much like a naughty child
										herself, enjoyed her tea. She and Kathleen laughed over the
										shrimps, exclaimed at the fun of eating the water-cress,
										enjoyed the sausages, and each drank four cups of tea. It was
										when the meal had come to an end that Kathleen said calmly:</p>

									<p>"Three or four, or perhaps five, ladies called while
										Maria was out."</p>

									<p>"Who were they, dear?"</p>

									<p>"I don't know. They left messages, and I have forgotten
										them. One lady was dressed in what I should call a very loud
										style. She was quite old. Her face was all over wrinkles. She
										was stout, and she wore a short jacket and a big—very
										big—picture-hat."</p>

									<p>"You don't mean," said Mrs. Tennant, "that Mrs. Dalzell
										has called? She is one of my most important friends. She
										promised to help me with regard to David's future. What did
										she say—can't you remember?"</p>

									<p>"I am ever so sorry, but I can't. I kept staring at her
										hat all the time. I don't remember anything about her except
										that she was old and had wrinkles and a big picture-hat—the
										sort of hat that Ruth Craven would look pretty in."</p>

									<p>
										Mrs. Tennant began to find the remembrance of her delightful
										tea a little depressing, for, question Kathleen as she might,
										she did not remember anything about the ladies except a few
										fugitive descriptions. As far as Mrs. Tennant
										<!-- Page 79 -->
										<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a> could make out, people who
										were of the greatest importance to her had left messages, and
										yet none of the messages could be attended to.
									</p>

									<p>"I can't even imagine who the other ladies can be," she
										said. "But as to Mrs. Dalzell, she must not be neglected; I
										must go out and see her at once."</p>

									<p>"Then you will be more tired than ever, and I have not
										done a scrap of good."</p>

									<p>"You meant very kindly, my dear child, and have given me
										a delicious and strengthening tea. Only don't do it again,
										darling, for it is my place to give you tea, not yours to give
										it to me."</p>

										<h3>THE QUEEN AND HER SECRET SOCIETY.</h3>


										<p>Mrs. Tennant had not been out more than a minute or two
											before David and Ben came in. Kathleen saw them from the
											window; she tapped on the window with her knuckles, nodded to
											them, kissed her hand, and looked radiant with delight. Some
											boys at the opposite side of the street saw her and burst out
											laughing. David's face grew red.</p>

										<p>"I wish the little Irish girl wouldn't make us figures
											of fun," said Ben, speaking in an annoyed tone.</p>

										<p>The next instant David had opened the door with his
											latchkey, and Kathleen was waiting for them in the hall.</p>

										<p>
											"Sausages," she said, bringing out the word with great gusto,
											"and shrimps, and water-cress, and sardines, besides
											bread-and-butter galore, and nice hot tea. Maria is mak
											<!-- Page 80 -->
											<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>ing fresh tea now in the
											kitchen. Come along in—do; you must be ravenous."
										</p>

										<p>The boys stared at her. Ben forgot his anger; he was
											schoolboy enough to thoroughly enjoy the delicious meal which
											Kathleen had prepared.</p>

										<p>When it came to an end David jumped up impatiently.</p>

										<p>"Where are you going, Dave?" asked Kathleen in an
											interested voice. She wanted him to help her. She had hoped
											that he and she would go away to the old loft together, and
											talk as they had done the night before. But David was firm.</p>

										<p>"I am going to the church," he said, "to practice on
											the organ. I only get the chance three times a week, and I
											must not neglect it."</p>

										<p>"David hopes to be no end of a swell some day,"
											remarked Ben. "He thinks he can make the instrument speak."</p>

										<p>"And so can I," said Kathleen. "May I come with you,
											Dave?"</p>

										<p>"Some day," he replied, looking at her kindly, "but not
											to-day. I'll be back as soon as I can."</p>

										<p>David did not notice her disappointed face; he went out
											immediately, without even going upstairs first. Ben and
											Kathleen were now alone. Kathleen looked at him attentively.</p>

										<p>"I wonder—" she said slowly.</p>

										<p>"What are you staring at me for?" said Ben.</p>

										<p>"I have been wondering what sort you are. I have got
											cousins at home, and they do anything in the world I like. I
											wonder if you would."</p>

										<p>
											Ben had been very cross with Kathleen when she had knocked to
											him and David from the dining-room window, but he was not
											cross now. He was only thirteen, and up
											<!-- Page 81 -->
											<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a> to the present no pretty
											girl had ever taken the slightest notice of him. He was a
											plain, sandy-haired boy, with a freckled face, a wide mouth,
											and good-humored blue eyes.
										</p>

										<p>"You make me laugh whenever I look at you," was
											Kathleen's next candid remark.</p>

										<p>"I didn't know that I was so comical," was his answer.</p>

										<p>"Perhaps you don't like it."</p>

										<p>"I can't say I do."</p>

										<p>"Well, this is the Palace of Home Truths," said
											Kathleen, laughing. "I asked your darling, saintly sister
											just now which was the most wicked—to tell a polite lie, or a
											frightfully rude home truth. She said that a polite lie was
											an awful sin, so in this house I must cleave to the home
											truths. I could tell you, you know, that you have quite a
											fascinating smile, and a very taking voice, and a delightful
											and polished manner; but I prefer to tell you that you are
											comical, which means that I feel inclined to burst out
											laughing whenever I look at you."</p>

										<p>"Thank you," said Ben, who could be very sulky when he
											liked. "Then I will take my objectionable presence out of
											your sight. I have got my lessons to do."</p>

										<p>Kathleen raised her brows and gave a slow smile. Ben
											got as far as the door.</p>

										<p>"Benny," she said then in a most seductive whisper.</p>

										<p>He turned.</p>

										<p>"I am so glad you are in."</p>

										<p>"I should not have thought so."</p>

										<p>
											"But I am. It is awfully lonely for a girl like me, who has
											got dozens of cousins at home, and uncles and aunts and all
											the rest of the goodly fry, to be stranded. I like David. I
											am quite smitten with David; and I like you, too. You can be
											a <i>great</i> friend of mine."
										</p>

										<p>"Oh, I don't mind," said Ben.</p>

										<p>
											<!-- Page 82 -->
											<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>He thought it would be
											very good fun to tell the other fellows about the charming
											Irish girl who liked him so much.
										</p>

										<p>"I wonder if you'd help me, Ben."</p>

										<p>"What can I do?" asked Ben.</p>

										<p>"Sit down, and let's be cozy. I will sit in the tired
											one's chair, and you can sit on that little stool at my feet.
											Now isn't that nice?"</p>

										<p>"Who do you mean by the tired one?"</p>

										<p>"Your mother, silly boy, of course."</p>

										<p>"It is a very ridiculous name to call her."</p>

										<p>"It belongs to the Palace of Home Truths. Your mother
											is tired, and you—you lazy omadhauns—"</p>

										<p>"Well, go on," said Ben. "I see by your manner that you
											want me to do something. I suppose it's something a little
											bit—a little bit not quite good."</p>

										<p>"It is perfectly good. I'll love you ever so much if
											you will do it."</p>

										<p>"What is it?"</p>

										<p>"I am going out this evening. I may not be in until
											late. If the others are in bed, will you come and unlock the
											door for me when I throw gravel up at your window? You must
											tell me which is your window."</p>

										<p>"I sleep in the north attic. It doesn't look out on to
											the street; and I can't—I can't possibly do it."</p>

										<p>"You can come down and wait for me in the hall."</p>

										<p>"How can I?"</p>

										<p>"When the tired one goes to bed, you can come down. She
											goes to bed at ten, I know, and I shall not be in until about
											half-past ten. I don't want Dave to know—well, because I
											don't. I don't want Alice to know, because I dislike Alice
											very much."</p>

										<p>"Really, Kathleen, you ought not to speak like that."</p>

										<p>
											<!-- Page 83 -->
											<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>"Well, I do, and I can't
											help myself. Will you do what I want? Here, do you think
											you'd like this in your possession?"
										</p>

										<p>As Kathleen spoke she held out a golden sovereign in
											the palm of her little hand.</p>

										<p>"I don't want to be bribed."</p>

										<p>"It isn't bribery really; it is paying you for giving
											me a great convenience. I must go out on important business.
											I want to help those who are down-trodden and distressed.
											Will you do what I want, Ben—will you, dear Ben? You know I
											like you so much. Will you—will you?"</p>

										<p>Of course, Ben fought against Kathleen's rather wicked
											suggestion; of course in the end he yielded. When he finally
											got up to his attic to thumb over his well-worn lesson-books
											he had Kathleen's golden sovereign in his pocket. He took it
											out and looked at it; he turned it round and round and
											examined it all over. He rubbed it lovingly against his
											freckled cheek, held it until it got warm in the palm of his
											hand, and then put it back in his pocket and jingled it
											against a couple of pennies which were its only companions.</p>

										<p>"A whole sovereign," he said to himself—"a whole
											sovereign, and I never had so much as five shillings of my
											own in the whole course of my life. Well, she is a little
											witch. I suppose Dave would beat me black and blue for doing
											a thing of this sort. But how could I—how could I withstand
											her?"</p>

										<p>
											Supper at the Tennants' generally consisted of cold pudding,
											cold meat, bread-and-butter, and a little jam when there
											happened to be any in the house. It was not a particularly
											tempting meal, and those who ate it required to have good,
											vigorous appetites. Kathleen, although she had been brought
											up in a considerable amount of wasteful
											<!-- Page 84 -->
											<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a> splendor, was indifferent
											to what she ate. She soon jumped up and walked across the
											little passage into the drawing-room. Ben, looking very red
											and shamefaced, would not meet her eyes. Ben's face annoyed
											Kathleen. It did not occur to her for a minute that he would
											not be faithful to her, but she was afraid that others might
											notice his extraordinary and perturbed expression. Once, too,
											he jingled the sovereign in his pocket; she heard him, and
											wondered why David did not ask him where he had got the
											money. But no remark was made, and the meal came safely to an
											end. Kathleen took up the first book she could find and
											pretended to read.
										</p>

										<p>"I shall feign sleepiness at a quarter to nine," she
											said to herself, "and go upstairs. I shall be awfully polite
											and sweet to dear Alice. She never comes to bed before ten,
											so I shall be quite safe getting out of the house. I can drop
											from the window, but I should prefer going by the back door;
											and I don't think Maria will betray me."</p>

										<p>Just then Alice strolled into the room. She looked
											rather nice; she wore a very pretty pink muslin blouse, which
											suited her well. Her hair was neatly arranged; her face was
											calm. She stood before Kathleen.</p>

										<p>"I wish—" she said suddenly.</p>

										<p>Kathleen raised her head.</p>

										<p>"And I wish you wouldn't stand between me and the lamp.
											Don't you see that I am reading?"</p>

										<p>"I want you to stop reading. I have something to say."</p>

										<p>"Indeed!"</p>

										<p>Kathleen longed to be very rude, but she thought of her
											delightful plan so close at hand, and refrained.</p>

										<p>
											"I must humor her if I can by any possibility keep my
											temper," was her thought. Then aloud: "What is it you
											<!-- Page 85 -->
											<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a> want? I hope you will be
											very quick, for I am rather sleepy and intend to go to bed
											soon."
										</p>

										<p>"I hope you won't do it again, that's all."</p>

										<p>"Do what again?" asked Kathleen.</p>

										<p>"Spend your money on buying food for us. We are not so
											poor as all that. My mother is paid by your father to give
											you your meals; your father doesn't expect you to buy them
											over again."</p>

										<p>"Dad always likes me to do what I wish," replied
											Kathleen calmly.</p>

										<p>"Well, don't do it again. It's extremely displeasing
											both to David and me."</p>

										<p>Kathleen laughed.</p>

										<p>"Dave gobbled up his sausage and his sardines," she
											said.</p>

										<p>"Don't do it again, that's all."</p>

										<p>Kathleen nodded her head, and again buried herself in
											her book.</p>

										<p>"And there is another thing," continued Alice, dropping
											into a chair by Kathleen's side. "You are very low down in
											the school. Two of the mistresses spoke to me about you
											to-day. They don't like to see a great overgrown girl like
											you in a class with little children; it does neither you nor
											the school credit. They fear that during this term you may be
											forced to continue in your present low position; but they
											earnestly hope that you will work very hard, so as to be
											removed into a higher form. You ought, after Christmas, to
											get into a class at least two removes higher up in the
											school. That is what I came to say. I suppose you have a
											certain sense of honor, and you don't want your father's
											money to be thrown away."</p>

										<p>"Bedad, then! he has plenty of money, and I don't much
											care," replied Kathleen.</p>

										<p>
											<!-- Page 86 -->
											<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>She lay back in her chair
											and whistled "Garry Owen" in a most insolent manner.
										</p>

										<p>"If you have really made up your mind not to improve
											yourself in the very least, mother had better write to Squire
											O'Hara and suggest that you don't come back after Christmas."</p>

										<p>"And Squire O'Hara will decide that point for himself,"
											replied Kathleen. "There are other houses where I can be
											entertained and fussed over, and regarded as I ought to be
											regarded, besides the home of Alice Tennant. The fact is
											this, Alice: you aggravate me; you don't understand me; I am
											at my worst in your presence. Perhaps I am a bit wild
											sometimes, but your way would never drive me to work or
											anything else. I have no real dislike to learning, and if
											another girl spoke to me as you have done I might be very
											glad."</p>

										<p>"What do you mean?" said poor Alice. "I really and
											truly, Kathleen, do want to help you. You and I could work
											every evening together; I could, and would, see you through
											your lessons. Thus you would very quickly get to the head of
											your class, and get your removes without trouble at
											Christmas."</p>

										<p>"I suppose you mean to be kind," said Kathleen. "I will
											think it over. Let me alone now."</p>

										<p>She gave a portentous yawn. Ben heard her, came and sat
											down on an ottoman not far off, and began kicking his legs.</p>

										<p>"Benny," said his sister, "if you have done your
											lessons, you had better go to bed."</p>

										<p>"I don't want to go so early. You always treat me as if
											I were a baby."</p>

										<p>
											"Well, please yourself. I am going upstairs to fetch my
											<!-- Page 87 -->
											<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a> books. I have a good hour
											and a half of hard work to get through before bedtime."
										</p>

										<p>The moment Kathleen and Ben were alone, Ben rushed up
											to her side and began to whisper.</p>

										<p>"It is all as right as possible," he said. "I am going
											up to bed as usual, and when mother and Alice and Dave are
											safe in their rooms I'll slip down again. I'll be in the
											hall. Don't ring when you come back; just walk up the steps
											and scratch against the door with your knuckles, and I'll
											hear you and let you in in a trice. I am awfully pleased
											about that sovereign; it will make me one of the greatest
											toffs in the school. I'll have more money than any of the
											other fellows. I'm so excited I can scarcely think of
											anything else. I know I'm doing wrong, but you did offer me
											such a tremendous temptation. Now I hear Alice's step. It
											will be all right, Kathleen; don't you fear."</p>

										<p>Kathleen smiled to herself. The rest of her programme
											was carried out to a nicety. At a quarter to nine she
											complained of fatigue, bade Mrs. Tennant an affectionate
											good-night, nodded to Alice, and left the room.</p>

										<p>"Be sure you don't lock the door," called Alice after
											her. "I sha'n't be up for quite an hour, and you will be
											sound asleep by that time."</p>

										<p>"I won't lock it," replied Kathleen gently.</p>

										<p>When Kathleen had gone upstairs, Mrs. Tennant turned
											and spoke to her daughter.</p>

										<p>"You know, Alice," she said, "the child is very lovable
											and kind-hearted—a little barbarian in some senses of the
											word, but a fine nature—of that I am certain."</p>

										<p>"I am so busy to-night, mother," replied Alice. "Can't
											we defer talking of the charms of Kathleen's character until
											after I have done my lessons?"</p>

										<p>"Of course, dear," said her mother.</p>

										<p>
											<!-- Page 88 -->
											<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>She drew her basket of
											mending towards her, put stitch after stitch into the shabby
											garments, and thought all the time of Kathleen with her
											bright face and beautiful, merry eyes.
										</p>

										<p>Meanwhile that young lady, having arranged a bolster in
											her bed to look as like a human being as possible, put on her
											hat and jacket and ran downstairs. There was no one in the
											hall, and she was absolutely daring enough to go out by that
											door. Mrs. Tennant raised her head when she heard the door
											gently shut.</p>

										<p>"Can that be the post?" she said; but as no one
											replied, she forgot the circumstance and went on with her
											mending.</p>

										<p>A few doors down the street Susy Hopkins was waiting
											for Kathleen.</p>

										<p>"Oh, there you are!" she said. "We are so excited!
											There will be about eight of us waiting for you in the old
											quarry. You are good to come. You don't know what this means
											in our lives. You are good—you are wonderfully good."</p>

										<p>"Where's the quarry?" asked Kathleen. "You have chosen
											such a funny place. I should not have imagined that a
											quarry—a dear, romantic quarry—could be found anywhere in
											this neighborhood."</p>

										<p>"Yes, but there is, and a good big one, too. It is
											about half a mile away, just at the back of Colliers'
											Buildings. It is the safest place you can possibly imagine,
											for no one will ever look for us there. Now do be quick; we
											will find the others before us. You can't think how excited
											we are."</p>

										<p>"Oh, I'm willing to be quick," replied Kathleen. "I am
											doing all this for you, you know, because I am sorry for the
											foundationers, and think it so very ridiculous that there
											should be distinctions made. Why, you are quite as good as
											the others. They are none of them much to boast of."</p>

										<p>
											<!-- Page 89 -->
											<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>"What fun this is!" cried
											Susy again. "I assure you the paying girls think no end of
											themselves. They are under the supposition that there never
											were such fine ladies to be found in the land before. Oh, we
											will take it out of them, sha'n't we?"
										</p>

										<p>Kathleen made no reply. Presently they reached the
											opening that led into the quarry. They had to go down a
											narrow sloping path, and then by a doorway cut in the solid
											rock. After they had passed through they found themselves in
											a large circular cavern open to the sky. There was no moon
											and the night was dark; but one girl had brought a lantern.
											She opened it and placed it on the ground; a bright shaft of
											light now fell on several young figures all huddled together.
											Susy gave a sharp whistle; the girls started to their feet.</p>

										<p>"Here we are, girls. See, this is our queen," and she
											presented Kathleen to the assembled girls.</p>

										<p>"Does the queen mind our looking at her face in turns?"
											said Kate Rourke. "I have not specially noticed you before,"
											she continued, "but after we have each had a good stare we
											will know what sort of girl you are."</p>

										<p>For reply Kathleen herself lifted the lantern and flung
											the full light upon her radiant and lovely face and figure.
											The intense light made her golden hair shine, and brought out
											the delicate perfection of each feature; the merry eyes
											framed in their dark lashes, the gleaming white teeth, the
											rosy lips were all apparent. But beyond the mere beauty of
											feature Kathleen had to a remarkable degree the far more
											fascinating beauty of expression: her face was capable of
											almost every shade of emotion, being sorrowful and pathetic
											one moment, and brimful of irrepressible mirth and roguery
											the next.</p>

										<p>
											<!-- Page 90 -->
											<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>There was a silence
											amongst the girls until Mary Rand shouted:
										</p>

										<p>"Hip! hip! hurrah!"</p>

										<p>The whole eight immediately broke into a ringing cheer.</p>

										<p>"Welcome, Queen Kathleen," they said—"welcome;" and
											they held out their hands and clasped the hands of the Irish
											girl.</p>

										<p>"I am glad," said Kathleen.</p>

										<p>"What about?" said Clara Sawyer.</p>

										<p>"Why, you have crowned me queen yourselves. Now I can
											do what I like with you all."</p>

										<p>"You certainly can," said Susy Hopkins.—"We are devoted
											to our queen, aren't we, girls?"</p>

										<p>"We have fallen in love with her on the spot," said
											Rosy Myers.</p>

										<p>"I never saw any one quite so lovely before as the
											queen," said Mary Rand.</p>

										<p>"It isn't only that she's lovely, she is so genteel,"
											said Susy Hopkins.</p>

										<p>"Aristocratic!" cried Kate.—"Hannah Johnson, you
											haven't given your opinion yet.—And, Ruth Craven, you haven't
											given yours."</p>

										<p>"I reserve my opinion," said Ruth.</p>

										<p>"And I say there's a great deal of humbug and
											balder-dash in the world," said Hannah Johnson.</p>

										<p>Ruth's remark was unexpected, but the girls pooh-poohed
											Hannah's. Who was Hannah Johnson that she dared to speak so
											rudely to one so charming and beautiful as Kathleen O'Hara?
											There was a disconcerting pause, and then Kathleen said:</p>

										<p>
											"Hannah, doubtless you are right. There is plenty of humbug
											in the world; but I don't think I am one. Now the question
											is: Shall I be on the side of the foundationers,
											<!-- Page 91 -->
											<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a> or shall I be on the side
											of the paying girls in the Great Shirley School?"
										</p>

										<p>"Indeed, darling," said Rosy Myers, "you shall be on
											our side. Those horrid, stuck-up paying girls don't want you;
											and we do. Nothing will induce us to give you up. It is a
											chance to get a girl like you, so lovely and so sweet and so
											rich, to be one of us."</p>

										<p>"Well, I think I can give you a good time, and I can
											show those others with their snobbish ways—"</p>

										<p>"Hear, hear!" cried the excited girls.</p>

										<p>"I can show the others what I think of them. They won't
											snub me, but perhaps I shall snub them. Well, girls, as we
											have decided to band together, we must draw up rules; and
											when they are drawn up we must obey them. I, of course, will
											be your head; as you have made me queen, that is the natural
											thing to expect."</p>

										<p>"Of course," said Susy.</p>

										<p>Kathleen clapped her hands.</p>

										<p>"This is going to be a real good secret society," she
											said. "What fun it all will be!"</p>

										<p>The girls laughed, and clustered with more and more
											friendliness round Kathleen.</p>

										<p>"You are our queen," said Kate. "There are eight of us
											here, and we all swear allegiance to you.—Don't we, girls?"</p>

										<p>"Certainly," said Susy.</p>

										<p>"Unquestionably," remarked Mary.</p>

										<p>"With all my heart," said Rose.</p>

										<p>"And mine," echoed Clara.</p>

										<p>"And mine," said Kate.</p>

										<p>"I will join the others, although I don't approve,"
											said Hannah Johnson, with a somewhat unwilling nod.</p>

										<p>
											<!-- Page 92 -->
											<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>"And I am neutral. I don't
											think I ought to join at all," said Ruth.
										</p>

										<p>"Oh, yes, you will, Ruth. I want you to be my Prime
											Minister, I want you to be with me in all things."</p>

										<p>"I don't know that I can."</p>

										<p>"And why should she be your Prime Minister?" said Kate
											in an ugly voice. "She's no better than the others, and she's
											very new. Some of us have been at the school for some time.
											Ruth Craven has only just joined.</p>

										<p>"The queen must have her way," said Kathleen, stamping
											her foot. "The queen must have her way in all particulars,
											and she wishes to elect Ruth Craven as her Prime
											Minister—that is, if Ruth will consent."</p>

										<p>They were headstrong and big girls, most of them older
											than Kathleen, but they submitted, for her ways were
											masterful and her tone full of delicate sympathy.</p>

										<p>"I will think it over and let you know," said Ruth. "Of
											course, I shall not betray you; but you must please
											understand that I have friends amongst the paying girls of
											the school. Cassandra Weldon is my friend, and there are
											others. I will not join nor advocate any plan that annoys or
											worries them."</p>

										<p>The girls looked dubious, and one or two began to speak
											in discontented voices.</p>

										<p>
											"We must meet again in a couple of days," said Kathleen
											finally. "By then I shall have drawn up the rules. We can't
											always meet at night, but we will when it is possible, for
											this place is so romantic, and so correct for a secret
											society. Those who are present to-night will be in my
											Cabinet. I should like if possible to have all the foundation
											girls on my side, but that must be decided at our next
											meeting. I am willing to purchase a badge for
											<!-- Page 93 -->
											<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a> each girl who joins me;
											it will be made of silver, and can be worn beneath the dress
											in the form of a locket."
										</p>

										<p>"Oh, lovely, delicious! There never was such a queen,"
											cried Susy Hopkins.</p>

										<p>The little meeting broke up amidst universal applause.</p>

											<h3>THE BOX FROM DUBLIN AND ITS TREASURES.</h3>


											<p>Kathleen returned quite safely to Myrtle Lodge. Ben
												was sitting up for her; he opened the door. The hall was
												quite dark. He held out his hand and drew her in.</p>

											<p>"Am not I splendid?" he said. "I have been standing
												here for half-an-hour, all drenched with perspiration. If
												mother came down" what wouldn't she say? And as to Alice,
												she'd be even worse. But a sov.'s worth doing something for.
												I say! I do feel happy! I never had all that lot of bullion
												in the whole course of my life before. Are you right now,
												Kathleen—can you slip upstairs without making any noise?
												Don't forget that the step just before you reach the upper
												landing gives a great creak like the report of a pistol; hop
												over it on to the landing itself, and you are safe. Alice is
												in bed, snoring like anything; I listened outside the
												keyhole."</p>

											<p>"Thanks," said Kathleen. "I'm awfully obliged to you,
												Ben. See if I don't do something for you. You are a broth of
												a boy. What do you say to Carrigrohane in the summer, and a
												gun all to yourself? I'll teach you how to shoot rabbits and
												to bring down a bird on the wing."</p>

											<p>
												She brushed her lips against his cheek, and ran lightly
												upstairs. She escaped the treacherous second step, and
												<!-- Page 94 -->
												<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a> entered her bedroom
												without waking Alice. The bolster carefully manipulated had
												done its work; it had never occurred to Alice that the form
												in the bed was anything but the living form of Kathleen
												O'Hara. She had shaded the light from what she supposed to
												be the sleeping girl, and got into bed herself feeling tired
												and sulky. She had dropped asleep immediately.
											</p>

											<p>Kathleen's first step, therefore, towards the
												formation of a secret society in the Great Shirley School
												was marked with success. The idea which she had formulated
												in the old quarry spread like wildfire amongst the
												foundationers; but Kathleen was determined not to have
												another meeting for nearly a week. She wished to hear from
												her father; she wanted to have money in hand.</p>

											<p>"They are all poor," she thought. "If I appear just as
												poor as they are, I shall never be able to keep my exalted
												position as queen. We cannot have our next meeting until I
												have drawn up the rules, and I should like Ruth Craven to
												help me. She has got sense. I don't want the thing to be
												riotous, nor to do harm in any way. I just want us to have a
												bit of fun, and to teach the horrid paying girls of the
												school a lesson."</p>

											<p>The thought of her secret society kept Kathleen in a
												fairly good humor, and she worked at her lessons so well
												that Alice began to have hopes of her. About a week after
												her arrival at Myrtle Lodge the box which Aunt Katie O'Flynn
												was sending from Dublin arrived. It came when the girls were
												at school. When they returned to early dinner they saw it
												standing in the front hall.</p>

											<p>"Whatever is this, and why is it put here?" said
												Alice, springing forward to look at the address:</p>

											<p>"Miss Kathleen O'Hara, care of Mrs. Tennant, Myrtle
												Lodge."</p>

											<p>
												<!-- Page 95 -->
												<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>"Golloptious!" cried
												Kathleen. "It's my own. It's my clothes—my sort of a kind of
												a treasure. Oh, what delicious fun! Now you will see how
												smart I can be. Maybe there will be something here to fit
												you, Alice. Wouldn't you like it? We are going to tea
												to-night to Mrs. Weldon's, and Ruth Craven is to be there.
												The darling girl—I will give her something. I should love to
												make her look just as beautiful as she can look. I am not a
												bit a stingy sort of girl; you know that, Alice. I want to
												be quite generous with my lovely things."
											</p>

											<p>"Well, do stop talking," said Alice. "I never came
												across such an inveterate chatterbox. I suppose you'd like
												to have the box taken up to our room; but I don't think
												you'll have any time to open it at present. You have
												promised to come back with me to the school this afternoon,
												in order that Miss Spicer may give you a special lesson in
												music."</p>

											<p>"Arrah, then, my dear!" cried Kathleen, "it isn't me
												you'll see at school again to-day. It's gloating and fussing
												over my clothes I will be—portioning out those I mean to
												give to others, and trying on the ones that will suit me.
												You can go to your horrid, stupid lessons if you like, but
												it won't be Kathleen O'Hara who will accompany you. Perhaps
												the poor tired one would like to have a pleasant afternoon
												in my bedroom. Oh, glory be to goodness! we will have a
												time. Isn't it worth anything to see that blessed trunk? My
												eyes can almost pierce through the deal and see the lovely
												garments folded away inside."</p>

											<p>Alice took no notice; she marched on to her room.
												Kathleen followed her.</p>

											<p>
												"The boys shall bring it up for me immediately after
												dinner," she said. "I sha'n't be going out again until I
												<!-- Page 96 -->
												<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a> go to Mrs. Weldon's. I
												expect people will open their eyes when they see me
												to-night."
											</p>

											<p>"You must please yourself, of course," said Alice.
												"For my part, I am extremely sorry that the trunk has come.
												You were settling down a little, and were not quite so
												objectionable as at first."</p>

											<p>
												"Thanks <i>awfully</i>, darling," said Kathleen, dropping a
												mock curtsy.
											</p>

											<p>"Not quite so objectionable," continued Alice in a
												calm voice. "But now, with all these silly gewgaws, you will
												be worse titan ever. But please clearly understand that I do
												not want any of your ornaments."</p>

											<p>"Don't trouble yourself, darling; they were not made
												for you. I force my treasures on nobody."</p>

											<p>"I wouldn't wear them if you were to give them. I hope
												I have some proper pride."</p>

											<p>
												"Pride of the <i>most</i> proper sort," said Kathleen,
												dancing before her.
											</p>

											<p>"And I do hope, also, that you won't make yourself a
												merry-andrew or a figure of fun at the Weldons' to-night. It
												will be in extremely bad taste. We are not going to have a
												large party—just one or two of the mistresses and little
												Ruth Craven, who, although she is a foundationer, seems to
												be a very nice sort of child. It would be in the worst taste
												possible to wear anything but the simplest clothes."</p>

											<p>"All right," said Kathleen. "If I am a chatterbox, you
												are about the greatest preacher, with the most long-winded
												sermons, that ever entered a house. You are a perfect plague
												to me, and that is the truth, Alice Tennant."</p>

											<p>Alice poured some water into her basin, washed her
												hands, and went downstairs.</p>

											<p>
												"Mother," she said, "I am obliged to be out the whole
												<!-- Page 97 -->
												<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a> afternoon. The
												scholarship examination takes place in six weeks now, and if
												I am to have any chance of getting through I must not idle a
												single moment. I grieve to say that a box of finery has
												arrived for Kathleen—most unsuitable, for she has plenty of
												clothes. I do trust, mother, you will keep her in tow a
												little this afternoon, and not allow her to make a show of
												herself."
											</p>

											<p>"You are not very kind to Kathleen," said Mrs.
												Tennant. "Why shouldn't the child enjoy her pretty things? I
												like to see girls nicely dressed. It is a great trial to me
												to be obliged to deny you the ribbons and frills and laces
												which most girls of your age possess."</p>

											<p>"Thanks, mother," answered Alice; "but if you were as
												Rich as Crœsus, I should not wish, while I am a schoolgirl,
												to dress any better than I do."</p>

											<p>"You certainly have a great deal of sense, dear; but
												don't be too hard on the little girl. Ah! here she comes.
												Now we must sit down to dinner at once."</p>

											<p>During dinner Kathleen's eyes sparkled so brightly,
												and she looked so merry and mysterious, that both the boys
												gazed at her in wonder.</p>

											<p>"Don't mind me," she said, whispering to David as she
												bent towards him. "It's in real downright delight I am. I am
												expecting to have the most wonderful joy all the afternoon
												that was ever given a girl. Ah, then, it's illegant myself
												will be when you see me next, boys. And do look at her! I
												declare she's getting crosser each minute."</p>

											<p>"Hush, Kathleen!" said David. "You must not say unkind
												things."</p>

											<p>"Don't trouble to reprove her, David," called out
												Alice in a calm and lofty tone. "I assure you she doesn't
												annoy me in the least. Sometimes I think there is a little
												gnat flying about and trying to sting me, but that's all."</p>

											<p>
												<!-- Page 98 -->
												<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>"And a charming metaphor,
												too," said Kathleen.
											</p>

											<p>She ate her meal soberly, but occasionally a bubble of
												laughter came to the surface, and her merry eyes glanced
												from Mrs. Tennant's face to Alice's, and from Alice's to
												those of the boys. The moment the meal came to an end
												Kathleen jumped up.</p>

											<p>"Now, then, my angels, you come with me," she said,
												and she caught David by the one hand and Ben by the other,
												and led her willing slaves into the hall.</p>

											<p>"Did you ever see anything like it?" said Alice to her
												mother. "She will ruin the boys in addition to all her other
												mischief. Mother, must we keep her long? It is really most
												disturbing."</p>

											<p>"If you would only take poor little Kathleen as she
												is, you would find her quite agreeable, Alice," was her
												mother's answer.</p>

											<p>"Oh dear, mother! you seem to be just as much
												infatuated as the others. But never mind. I am off now, and
												I need not be back in the house until it is time to dress to
												go to Mrs. Weldon's. I declare that girl is causing me to
												hate my home. I don't think its fair, whatever you may say
												to the contrary."</p>

											<p>Mrs. Tennant sighed. Alice had always been a little
												difficult; she was more than difficult at the present
												moment. But very soon afterwards the welcome bang of the
												hall door was heard, and the house was free.</p>

											<p>"Now for a jolly time," said Kathleen. "Tired one,
												where are you?"</p>

											<p>"Kathleen, you ought not to call me by that name. You
												ought to be more respectful."</p>

											<p>
												"Arrah, then, darling, I can't; 'tain't in me. I am so fond
												of you—oh, worra, worra! there's nothing I wouldn't do for
												you; but I must be as I'm made. You do look tired,
												<!-- Page 99 -->
												<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a> and tired you will go on
												looking until I take you to Carrigrohane to rest you and to
												feed you with good milk and good fruit and good eggs and
												good cream.—Now then, boys, lift up that trunk. Be aisy with
												it, so that you won't hurt it. Take it up to my bedroom and
												put it on the floor. Maybe there's something in it for you,
												or maybe there isn't—Mrs. Tennant, acushla! you will come
												along upstairs with me at once. You can bring your mending
												basket, and I will pop you into the arm-chair by the window,
												and we can consult together over the garments. It's fine
												I'll look when I have them on. Aunt Katie O'Flynn is a woman
												who has real taste, and I know she is going to dress me up
												as no other girl ever was dressed before in the Great
												Shirley School."
											</p>

											<p>Mrs. Tennant could not help laughing. The boys were
												also in the highest good-humor; Kathleen's mirth was
												contagious. They went upstairs to the bedroom, and then Ben
												saucily perched himself on the foot of one of the beds;
												while David, having brought up a hammer and screwdriver,
												proceeded to lift the lid of the box, which was firmly
												nailed down. Under the lid was a lot of tissue-paper.
												Kathleen went on her knees, lifted it up, uttered a shout,
												and turned to the boys.</p>

											<p>"You make off now," she said.</p>

											<p>"No, indeed I won't," said Ben. "I want to see the
												fun."</p>

											<p>"Go, both of you. There will be something nice for you
												when you come back to tea," said Kathleen.</p>

											<p>
												They looked regretful, but saw nothing for it but to go.
												Kathleen in a breathless sort of way, scarcely uttering a
												word, spread out her treasures on the bed. Was there ever
												such a box? Skirts, bodices, blouses, shirts; an evening
												dress, an afternoon dress, a morning dress—they
												<!-- Page 100 -->
												<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a> seemed simply endless.
												Then there were frills and ribbons and veils; there were two
												great, big, very stylish-looking hats, with long plumes; and
												there was a little toque made of crimson velvet, which
												Kathleen declared was quite too sweet for anything. There
												were also dozens of handkerchiefs, dozens of pairs of
												stockings, and some sweet little slippers all embroidered
												and fit for the most bewitching feet in the world.
												Kathleen's cheeks got redder and redder.
											</p>

											<p>"Here's a cargo for you," she said. "Here's something
												to delight the heart. Now, my dear Mrs. Tennant, let us come
												and examine everything. Do you think I am utterly selfish,
												Mrs. Tennant? Do you think I want all these things for
												myself?"</p>

											<p>"I am sure you don't, dear."</p>

											<p>"It quite makes me ache with longing to give some of
												them away. I don't want so many frocks: there are a good
												dozen here all told. Aunt Katie O'Flynn's the one for
												extravagance, bless her! and for having a thing done in
												style, bless her! I should like you to see her. It's
												splendacious she is entirely when she's dressed up in her
												best—velvet and feathers and laces and jewels. Why, nothing
												holds her in bounds; there's nothing she stops at. I have
												seen her give hundreds of pounds for one little glittering
												gem. Ah! and here's a ring. Look, Mrs. Tennant."</p>

											<p>Kathleen had now opened a small box which was lying at
												the bottom of the great trunk. There were several treasures
												in it: a necklet of glittering white stones, another of
												blue, another of red, and this little ring—a little ring
												which contained a solitary diamond of the purest water.</p>

											<p>"Now I shall look stylish," said Kathleen, and she
												slipped the ring on the third finger of her left hand.</p>

											<p>"My wedding finger too, bedad!" she said.</p>

											<p>
												<!-- Page 101 -->
												<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>When the contents of
												the trunk had been finally explored, Kathleen began to sort
												her finery. Mrs. Tennant gave advice.
											</p>

											<p>"Some of these things are a little too fine for
												everyday use," she said. "But some of these blouses are very
												suitable, and so are these white and gray and pink shirts.
												And this blue bodice is quite nice for the evening, and so
												is the skirt belonging to it; but this and this and this—I
												wouldn't wear these until I went home if I were you, my
												love."</p>

											<p>Kathleen glanced at her. A slight frown came between
												her brows.</p>

											<p>"Don't you see," she said impatiently, "that I want to
												give away some of these things? Do you see this dozen of
												blouses, all exactly alike, in this box? These are for the
												secret society."</p>

											<p>"The what, Kathleen?"</p>

											<p>"Oh, you musn't tell—it is the most profound
												secret—but I have joined one. Being an Irish girl, it is
												quite natural. I sent a line to Aunt Katie to get a dozen of
												the very prettiest blouses she could. Of course there are a
												lot more members, but our Cabinet has risen to something
												like a dozen, so I thought I'd have them handy. Aren't they
												just sweet?"</p>

											<p>As she spoke she took out of the box the palest blue
												cashmere blouse, most exquisitely trimmed with blue
												embroidery flecked with pink silk. The blouse had real lace
												round the neck and cuffs, and must have cost a great deal of
												money.</p>

											<p>"Don't you think Alice would look very nice in one of
												these?" said Kathleen, gazing with a very earnest face at
												Mrs. Tennant.</p>

											<p>
												<!-- Page 102 -->
												<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>"Pink is more Alice's
												color. She is too pale for blue," was Mrs. Tennant's reply.
											</p>

											<p>"Well, then, look here. Isn't this a perfect duck? See
												for yourself. It's a sort of cross between a coral and a
												rose—oh, so exquisite! And see how it is made, with all
												these teeny tucks and the embroidery let in between. And the
												sleeves—aren't they just illegant entirely? Don't you think
												we might make her wear it?"</p>

											<p>"I am sorry, Kathleen, but you are not getting on very
												well with Alice. I wish it were different. Could you not do
												something to propitiate her?"</p>

											<p>"Wisha, then, darling!" said Kathleen, pausing a
												moment to consider; "that's just what I can't do. Alice's
												ways are not my ways, and if I copied her it's kilt I'd be
												entirely. She never likes to see a smile on my face, and she
												can't abide to watch me if I dance a step, and she wouldn't
												take a joke out of me if it was to save her life. To please
												Alice I'd have to be the primmest of the prim, and always
												stooping over my horrid lessons, and the end of it there'd
												be no more of poor Kathleen O'Hara—- it's dead and in her
												grave she'd be, the creature. Indeed, I'm glad I'm not made
												on Alice's pattern, even if she is your daughter. I can't
												aspire to anything so fine and high up even for your sake,
												darling, and you are one of the sweetest women on God's
												earth. I couldn't do it—not by no means."</p>

											<p>Mrs. Tennant could not help laughing as Kathleen
												described the sort of girl she would be if she adopted
												Alice's role.</p>

											<p>
												"But the question is now," said the girl, "what are we to do
												to make her have some of these pretty things? Mightn't I
												give the blouse to you first, and you could give it to her?
												She'd look so sweet in this pink blouse when
												<!-- Page 103 -->
												<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a> she went to tea at her
												chosen friends. She'd be almost pretty if she was nicely
												dressed. I've got this white one for little Ruth Craven, and
												I want Alice to have this so badly. Can't you manage it,
												dear Mrs. Tennant?"
											</p>

											<p>Mrs. Tennant felt tempted. The blouse was very dainty
												and pretty, and unlike anything she could afford to buy for
												her only daughter. Kathleen threw her arms round her neck
												and kissed her.</p>

											<p>
												"You will—you will, dear Mrs. Tennant," she said. "It is
												yours entirely. You tell her you got it at a cheap sale. Say
												you went to a jumble sale and bought it; you paid
												one-and-twopence-halfpenny for it. That's the right figure,
												isn't it, for the best things at a jumble sale? Tell her
												it's <i>quite</i> new, and was thrown in promiscuous like."
											</p>

											<p>"But, my darling child, I can't tell her what isn't
												true. She would wear it if she didn't know it came from you.
												She would not only wear it, but she would delight in it; but
												nothing would induce her to take it if she thought you had
												given it."</p>

											<p>"Then don't let's tell her. Besides, it wouldn't be
												true, for I have given it to you, dear. And now, see, here
												is something for your sweet self. I wrote to Aunt Katie, and
												Aunt Katie is so clever. See! come to the glass."</p>

											<p>Kathleen had opened a cardboard box, and out of it she
												took a black velvet bonnet with nodding plumes and a little
												pink strip of velvet fastened under the brim. This she put
												with trembling fingers on Mrs. Tennant's head. Mrs. Tennant
												was in reality not at all old, and she looked quite young
												and pretty in the new toque.</p>

											<p>"You are charming, that's what you are," said
												Kathleen. "And I can't take it back, for you know perfectly
												well that it is a wee bit too old for me. You will have to
												wear it."</p>

											<p>
												<!-- Page 104 -->
												<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>"But what will Alice
												say?"
											</p>

											<p>"Never mind. Don't tell her; just be mum. Say, 'it is
												mine, and I mean to wear it.' Oh, I'd manage Alice if I
												happened to be her mother."</p>

											<p>"I don't think you would, dear."</p>

											<p>"Indeed, but I would. And now I must consider whom I
												am to give the other things to."</p>

											<p>When Kathleen had finally parcelled out her treasures
												there was not such a great deal left for herself, for this
												girl and the other who had taken her fancy were all allotted
												a treasure out of that famous box. And there was a thick
												albert chain made of solid silver for Ben, and a keyless
												silver watch for David; and what could boys possibly want
												more? Kathleen had remembered all her friends, and Aunt
												Katie O'Flynn was more than willing to carry out her
												request.</p>

											<p>Finally, at the very bottom of the trunk was a little
												parcel which she refrained from opening while Mrs. Tennant
												was present. It contained the badges of the new society.
												Kathleen had decided that they were to call themselves "The
												Wild Irish Girls," and this title was neatly engraved on the
												little badges, which were of the shape of hearts. Below the
												name was the device—a harp with a bit of shamrock trailing
												round it. The badges were small and exceedingly neat, and
												there were about sixty of them in all.</p>

											<p>"Now then, I can go ahead," thought Kathleen. "What
												with the finery for my dear, darling chosen ones, and the
												badges for all the members, I shall do."</p>

											<p>
												She was utterly reckless with regard to expense. Her father
												was rich, and he did not mind what he spent on his only
												child. The box seemed to fill up every crevice of her heart,
												as she expressed it, and it was a very happy girl who
												<!-- Page 105 -->
												<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a> dressed to go to the
												Weldons' that evening. Kathleen was intensely affectionate,
												and would have done anything in the world to please Mrs.
												Tennant; but when it came to wearing a very quiet gray dress
												with a little lace round the collar and cuffs, she begun to
												demur.
											</p>

											<p>"It can't be done," she thought. "Half of them will be
												in gray and half of them in brown, and a few old dowdies
												will perhaps be in black. But I must be gay; it isn't fair
												to Aunt Katie to be anything else."</p>

											<p>She made a wild and scarcely judicious selection. She
												put on crimson silk stockings, and tucked into her bag a
												pair of crimson satin shoes. Her dress consisted of a black
												velvet skirt over a crimson petticoat, and her bodice was of
												crimson silk very much embroidered and with elbow-sleeves.
												Round her neck she wore innumerable beads of every possible
												color, and twisted through her lovely hair were some more
												beads, which shone as the light fell on them. Altogether it
												was a very bizarre and fascinating little figure that
												appeared that evening at the Weldons' hall door. Over her
												showy dress she wore a long opera-cloak, so that at first
												her splendors were not fully visible. This gaily dressed
												little person entered a room full of sober people. The
												effect was somewhat the same as though a gorgeous butterfly
												had flown into the room. She lit up the dullness and made a
												centre of attraction—all eyes were fastened upon her; for
												Kathleen in her well-made dress, notwithstanding the gayety
												of its color, looked simply radiant. The mischief in her
												dark eyes, too, but added to her charm. She glanced with
												almost maliciousness at Alice, who, in the dowdiest of
												pale-gray dresses, with her hair rather untidy and her face
												destitute of color, was standing near one of the windows.
												And as Alice glanced at Kathleen she felt that she almost
												hated the Irish girl.</p>

												<h3>CONSCIENCE AND DIFFICULTIES.</h3>


												<p>All the people who knew her were beginning to make a
													fuss over Ruth Craven. She who had hardly ever been noticed
													during the early part of her life, who was just her
													grandfather's darling and her grandmother's idol, was now
													petted and made much of and fussed over by every one. It
													was quite an extraordinary thing for the paying girls of
													the Great Shirley School to be so interested and excited
													about a foundationer. Cassandra Weldon was not the only
													girl who had taken Ruth up; some of the best and nicest
													girls of the school began to patronize her. The fact was
													that she was very modest and a perfect lady, and it was
													impossible to feel anything but good-will towards her. The
													rest of the foundation girls at first determined that they
													would leave her with her fine friends, but when Kathleen
													insisted on Ruth's joining the secret society of the Wild
													Irish Girls, they were obliged to submit.</p>

												<p>"We'd do anything in the world for our queen," said
													Susy Hopkins, talking to another foundation girl one day as
													they strolled along the road. "It is to-night we are to
													meet again, and she says she will bring the rules all drawn
													up, and she will read them to us. There are about thirty of
													us now, and more and more offer to join every day. The
													difficulty is that we have got to keep the thing from the
													knowledge of the teachers and the paying girls of the
													school. Kathleen is certain that it would be suppressed if
													it were known; and it must not be known, for it is the
													biggest lark and the greatest fun we ever had in all our
													lives."</p>

												<p>
													<!-- Page 107 -->
													<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>"Yes," said Rosy
													Myers; "I feel now quite honored at being a foundation
													girl."
												</p>

												<p>"She does promise us wonderful things," said Kate
													Rourke. "She says when the summer comes we shall have all
													sorts of nice excursions. Of course, we can't do anything
													special in the daytime, unless sometimes on Saturday, when
													we have a whole holiday; but at least; she says, the nights
													are our own and we can do as we like. It really is grand. I
													suppose it is wicked, but then that makes it rather more
													fascinating."</p>

												<p>"We are in the queen's Cabinet, bless her, the duck!"
													said Susy Hopkins. "There are a dozen of us now, and there
													is talk of a sort of livery or badge for the members of the
													Cabinet; but we'll know all about it when we meet sharp at
													nine to-night. We are the twelve members of the Cabinet,
													and there are about twenty girls who are our sort of
													standing army. It is really most exciting."</p>

												<p>The girls talked a little longer and then parted. As
													Susy Hopkins was running home helter-skelter—for she wanted
													to get her lessons done in order to be fully in time for
													the meeting that evening—she met Ruth Craven. Ruth was
													walking slowly by with her usual demure and sweet
													expression.</p>

												<p>"Hullo!" called out Susy. "We'll meet to-night,
													sha'n't we?"</p>

												<p>"I don't know," said Ruth.</p>

												<p>"Aren't you coming? Why, you are sort of Prime
													Minister to the queen."</p>

												<p>"You don't think it right really, do you," said
													Ruth—"not from the bottom of your heart, I mean?"</p>

												<p>
													"Right or wrong, I mean to enjoy myself," said Susy
													Hopkins. "I suppose, if you come to analyse it, it is
													wrong, and not right. But, dear me, Ruth! what fun
													<!-- Page 108 -->
													<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a> should we poor girls
													have if we were too particular on these points?"
												</p>

												<p>"It always seems to me that it is worth while to do
													right," said Ruth.</p>

												<p>"So you say, but I don't quite agree with you. You
													will come to-night, in any case, won't you?"</p>

												<p>"Yes, I will come to-night; but I am not happy about
													it, and I wish Kathleen—Oh, I know it is very fascinating,
													and Kathleen is just delightful, but I should not like our
													teachers to know."</p>

												<p>"Of course not," said Susy, staring at her. "They'd
													soon put a stop to it."</p>

												<p>"Are you certain? I know so little about the school."</p>

												<p>"Certain? I'm convinced. Why, they'd be furious. I
													expect we'd be expelled."</p>

												<p>"Then that proves it. I didn't know there was any
													strict rule about it."</p>

												<p>"Why, what are you made of, Ruth Craven?"</p>

												<p>"I thought," said Ruth, "that when we were not in
													school we were our own mistresses."</p>

												<p>"To a certain extent, of course; but we have what is
													called the school character to keep up. We have, as it
													were, to uphold the spirit of the school. Now the spirit of
													the school is quite against secrecy in any form. Oh dear,
													why will you drag all this out of me? I'd made up my mind
													not to think of it, and now you have forced me to say it.
													Of course you will come to-night. You have to think of
													Kathleen as well as the school, and she's gone to a fearful
													lot of expense. You could not by any possibility forsake
													her, could you?"</p>

												<p>"No, of course not," said Ruth very slowly.</p>

												<p>She bade Susy good-bye and walked on; her attitude
													was that of one who was thinking hard.</p>

												<p>
													<!-- Page 109 -->
													<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>"Ruth is very pretty,"
													said Susy to herself, "but I don't know that I quite admire
													her. She is the sort of girl that everybody loves, and I am
													not one to admire a universal favorite. She is frightfully,
													tiresomely good, and she's just <i>too</i> pretty; and
													she's not a bit vain, and she's not a bit puffed up. Oh,
													she is just right in every way, and yet I feel that I hate
													her. She has got the sort of conscience that will worry our
													queen to distraction. Still, once she joins she'll have to
													obey our rules, and I expect our queen will make them
													somewhat stringent."
												</p>

												<p>A clock from a neighboring church struck the
													half-hour. Susy looked up, uttered an exclamation, put
													wings to her feet, and ran the rest of the way home. Susy's
													home was in the High Street of the little town of
													Merrifield. Her mother kept a fairly flourishing
													stationer's shop, in one part of which was a post-office.
													Some ladies were buying stamps as Susy dashed through the
													shop on her way to the family rooms at the back. Mrs.
													Hopkins was selling stationery to a couple of boys; she
													looked up as her daughter entered. Susy went into the
													parlor, where tea was laid on the table. It consisted of a
													stale loaf, some indifferent butter, and a little jam. The
													tea, in a pewter teapot, was weak; the milk was sky-blue,
													and the jug that held it was cracked.</p>

												<p>Susy poured out a cup of tea, drank it off at a gulp,
													snatched a piece of bread-and-butter from the plate, and
													sat down to prepare her lessons at another table. She had
													two hours' hard work before her, and it was already nearly
													six o'clock. The quarry was a little distance away, and she
													must tidy herself and do all sorts of things. Just then her
													mother came in.</p>

												<p>
													"Oh, Susy," she said, "I am so glad you have come! I want
													you to attend to the shop for the next hour. I am
													<!-- Page 110 -->
													<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a> sent for in a hurry
													to my sister's; she has a bad cold, and wants me to call
													in. I think little Peter is not well; your aunt is afraid
													he is catching measles. Run into the shop the moment you
													have finished your tea, like a good child. You can take one
													of your lesson-books with you if you like. There won't be
													many customers at this hour."
												</p>

												<p>"Oh, mother, I did really want to work hard at my
													lessons. They are very difficult, you know, and you
													promised that when I went to the Great Shirley School you'd
													never interfere with my lesson hours."</p>

												<p>"I did say so, and of course I don't mean to
													interfere; but this is a special case."</p>

												<p>"Can't Tommy go and stand in the shop? If any special
													customers come in I will attend to them."</p>

												<p>"No, Tommy can't. He has a headache and is lying down
													upstairs. You must oblige me this time, Susy. You can sit
													up a little longer to-night to finish your lessons if you
													are much interrupted while I am away."</p>

												<p>"You are sure you will not be more than an hour,
													mother?"</p>

												<p>"Oh, certain."</p>

												<p>"And I suppose in any case I may shut up the shop at
													seven o'clock, mayn't I?"</p>

												<p>"Shut the shop at seven o'clock!" said Mrs. Hopkins.
													"You forget that this is Wednesday. We always keep the
													shop, except the post-office part, open until past nine on
													Wednesdays; such a lot of people come in for odds and ends
													on this special night. But I will be back long before nine.
													Don't on any account shut the shop until I appear."</p>

												<p>
													Susy, feeling cross and miserable, all her bright hopes
													dashed to the ground, took a couple of books and went into
													the shop and sat behind the counter. The days were getting
													short and cold, and as the shop door was opened there
													<!-- Page 111 -->
													<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a> was a thorough
													draught where she was sitting. Her feet grew icy cold; she
													could scarcely follow the meaning of her somewhat difficult
													lessons. No customers appeared.
												</p>

												<p>"How stupid I am!" thought the little girl. "This
													will never do."</p>

												<p>She roused herself, and bending forward, propped her
													book open before her. Presently she heard the clock outside
													strike seven.</p>

												<p>"Mother will be back now, thank goodness!" she
													thought. "If I work desperately hard, and stop my ears so
													that I needn't hear a sound, I may have done by nine
													o'clock."</p>

												<p>Just at that moment two ladies came in to ask for a
													special sort of stationery. Susy, who was never in the
													least interested in the shop, did not know where to find
													it. She rummaged about, making a great mess amongst her
													mother's neat stores; and finally she was obliged to say
													that she did not know where it was.</p>

												<p>"Never mind," said one of the ladies, kindly; "I will
													come in again next time I am passing. It doesn't matter
													this evening."</p>

												<p>
													Susy felt vexed; she knew her mother would blame her for
													sending the ladies away without completing a purchase. And
													they had scarcely left before she found the box which
													contained the stationery. She pushed it out of sight on the
													shelf, and sat down again to her book. Her mother ought to
													be coming in now. Susy would have to do a lot of exercises;
													these she could not by any possibility do in the shop. She
													had also some mathematical work to get through or she would
													never be able to keep her place in class. Why didn't Mrs.
													Hopkins return? Half-an-hour went by; three-quarters. It
													was now a quarter to eight. Susy felt quite distracted.
													With the exception of the two ladies, there had been no
													customer in the shop up to the present.
													<!-- Page 112 -->
													<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a> The fact was, they
													did not begin to appear until soon after eight on Wednesday
													evenings. Then the schoolgirls and schoolboys and many
													other people of the poorer class used to drop in for
													penn'orths and ha'p'orths of stationery, for pens, for ink,
													for sealing-wax, &amp;c.
												</p>

												<p>"Mother must be in soon. I know what I will do," said
													Susy. "I will open the door of the parlor and sit there. If
													any one appears I can dash out at once."</p>

												<p>No sooner had the thought come to her than she
													resolved to act on it. She turned on the gas in the
													parlor—it was already brightly lighted in the shop—and sat
													down to her work.</p>

												<p>"An hour and a quarter before the meeting of the Wild
													Irish Girls," she said to herself. "Strange, is it not,
													that I should call myself a Wild Irish Girl when I am a
													Cockney through and through? Well, whatever happens, I
													shall be at the meeting."</p>

													</h2>

													<h3>THE WILD IRISH GIRLS' SOCIETY IS STARTED.</h3>


													<p>
														While Susy sat in the parlor a tramp happened to pass the
														brightly lighted shop. He was weather-beaten and slipshod,
														and altogether made a most disreputable appearance. A hand
														was thrust into each of his pockets, and these pockets
														were destitute of coin. The tramp was hungry and
														penniless. The little shop with its gay light and tempting
														articles of stationery, and books and sealing-wax
														displayed in the window, were quite to the man's taste. He
														could not see the parlor beyond, nor the peep-hole where
														Susy was supposed to be able to watch the shop; he only
														<!-- Page 113 -->
														<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a> noticed that no one
														was within. The tramp was in the humor to do something
														desperate; he entered the shop under the pretense of
														begging; made straight for the till, pulled it open, and
														took out a handful of money. He had no time to count his
														spoils, but leaving the till-drawer still open, he dashed
														out of the shop.
													</p>

													<p>Now it so happened that Susy, just when the tramp
														stole in, had gone upstairs to fetch a fresh
														exercise-book. She noticed nothing amiss on her return,
														and went tranquilly on with her work. Eight o'clock
														struck. Susy was in despair.</p>

													<p>"I can't possibly fail Kathleen," she said to
														herself. "She started this splendid idea in order to help
														me and give me pleasure. I must be at the quarry whatever
														happens to-night. Something very unusual is detaining
														mother. I know what I'll do: I'll shut up the shop at
														half-past eight, leave a little note for mother, and then
														go to the quarry as fast as I can. I will tell mother that
														I am due at an important meeting, and she is sure not to
														question me; mother is always very kind, and gives me as
														much liberty as she can."</p>

													<p>Susy made a great struggle to keep her mind centered
														on her books, but with all her efforts her thoughts would
														wander. They wandered to Kathleen and the Wild Irish
														Girls' Society; they wandered to her other schoolfellows;
														they wandered to the hardship of having to take care of
														the shop when she wished to be otherwise employed; and
														finally they settled themselves on Ruth Craven. She could
														not help wondering what Ruth would do—whether she would
														continue to be a valuable aid to the queen of the new
														society, or whether she would give them up altogether.</p>

													<p>
														"I'd almost like her not to stay with us," thought Susy;
														"for then perhaps Kathleen would make me her Prime
														<!-- Page 114 -->
														<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a> Minister. I'd like
														that. Kathleen is the dearest, truest, greatest lady I
														ever came across. She doesn't think anything of birth, nor
														of those sort of tiresome distinctions; she thinks of you
														for what you are worth yourself. And she is so splendid to
														look at, and has such a gallant sort of way. I do admire
														her just!"
													</p>

													<p>The shop-bell rang. Susy was out in a moment. A
														woman had called for a penn'orth of paper and an envelope.
														She put down her penny on the counter, and Susy supplied
														her from a special box.</p>

													<p>"I was in such a taking," said the woman. "I just
														remembered at the last moment that all the shops were
														shut. I don't know what I should have done if I hadn't
														recalled that Mrs. Hopkins kept hers open until nine
														o'clock. I am obliged to you, little girl. I have to send
														this letter to my son in India, and I'd miss the mail if
														it wasn't posted to-night. You couldn't now, I suppose,
														oblige me with a stamp."</p>

													<p>"Of course I can," said Susy, cheerfully. "Mother
														always keeps a supply of stamps in the till."</p>

													<p>She turned to the till as she spoke, and for the
														first time noticed that the drawer was open.</p>

													<p>"How careless of me not to have shut it!" she
														thought.</p>

													<p>
														It did not occur to her to examine its contents, or to
														suppose for a single moment that any one had taken money
														out of it. She provided the woman with a stamp, and then,
														shut the drawer of the till. It was now half-past eight,
														and Susy determined to take the bull by the horns and to
														close the shop without further ado. She sent for the
														little maid in the kitchen to put up the shutters, and in
														a minute or two the shop was in darkness and Susy was
														racing through the remainder of her lessons. It would take
														her a quarter of an hour, running most of the way, to
														reach
														<!-- Page 115 -->
														<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a> the old quarry, and
														she must have three or four minutes to dress. She stood
														up, therefore, at her work, in order, as she expressed it,
														to save time. She was so occupied when her mother came in.
													</p>

													<p>"Why have you shut the shop?" said Mrs. Hopkins in
														an annoyed voice. "It is only a very little past half-past
														eight, and I saw two poor women outside. They wanted a
														penn'orth of paper each. They said, 'We thought you always
														kept open until nine o'clock,' Now it will spread all over
														the place that I shut at half-past eight. Why did you do
														it, Susy? It's hard enough to make ends meet without
														adding any more difficulties."</p>

													<p>Mrs. Hopkins stood, looking very pale and perplexed,
														in the parlor. Susy glanced at her mother, and could not
														help reflecting that the poor woman was fit to drop.</p>

													<p>"Do sit down, mother," she said. "I was so
														distracted; I have to be a good way from here at nine
														o'clock, I couldn't think whatever kept you. I was obliged
														to shut the shop. I am sorry."</p>

													<p>"Well, never mind. You didn't tell me that you were
														going out. I wish you wouldn't go out so much in the
														evening, Susy; it does make it so hard for me. There's no
														one now to help me with a bit of mending, and all your
														things are getting so racketed through."</p>

													<p>"What kept you, mother?" said Susy, ignoring her
														mother's speech.</p>

													<p>
														"Oh, it was your aunt. She's in such a taking about little
														Peter; she's quite certain he's in for measles or
														something worse. I'm persuaded that it's nothing but a
														cold. I never saw such a muddle-headed woman as your aunt
														Bessie. She hadn't a thing handy in the place. I had to
														stay and see the doctor, and then to fetch the medicine
														<!-- Page 116 -->
														<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a> myself, and then put
														the child to bed. I assure you I haven't sat down since I
														left."
													</p>

													<p>"And I suppose she never thought of giving you as
														much as a cup of tea?" said Susy.</p>

													<p>"No," answered her mother; then catching sight of
														the teapot, she added, "You might have had the tea-things
														removed, Susy. I will make myself a fresh cup."</p>

													<p>Susy stood still for a moment. Temptation tugged at
														her heart. Her mother certainly required if ever a mother
														did require a daughter. But the Wild Irish Girls—surely
														they were pining for her in the distance!</p>

													<p>"I wish I could help you, mother. I would if I
														hadn't promised to go out. If you will give me the
														latchkey I can let myself in. You needn't wait up; I
														promise to lock up carefully."</p>

													<p>"Very well, dear," said Mrs. Hopkins.</p>

													<p>She did not reproach Susy; that was not her way. She
														put a little kettle on the gas-stove, fetched a clean cup
														and saucer, and presently sat down to her belated meal.</p>

													<p>Susy dashed upstairs. She put on her hat and jacket,
														snatched up a pair of gloves, and the next moment was out
														of the house.</p>

													<p>"Free at last," she thought. "But, oh, what an
														evening I have had! I must say it is horrid to be poor.
														Now, if I was rich like Kathleen, wouldn't I have a gay
														time of it? Poor dear mother should drive in a carriage,
														and I'd ride on my pony by her side; and Tom should be a
														public school boy. There'd be no horrid shop then, and no
														horrid women coming in for ha'p'orths and penn'orths of
														paper."</p>

													<p>
														But as she ran through the autumn night-air she felt that,
														after all, there was something good in life. Her pulses,
														which had been languid enough in the stuffy little parlor
														at the back of the shop, now galloped fiercely. She
														<!-- Page 117 -->
														<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a> arrived two or three
														minutes after nine, but still in fairly good time to see a
														number of dark heads surrounding a bright light. This
														light was caused by two lamps which had been placed on the
														ground in the old quarry; Kathleen had brought them
														herself in a hamper. She had managed to buy them that day,
														and had smuggled them off without any one being the wiser.
														A large bottle of crystalline oil accompanied the lamps.
														Kathleen, who had dressed lamps for pleasure at home, knew
														quite well how to manage them, and when Susy appeared they
														stood at each end of a wide patch of light. Kathleen
														herself was in the midst of the light, and the other girls
														clustered round the edge.
													</p>

													<p>"Isn't it scrumptious?" said Kate Rourke.—"Oh, is
														that you, Susy Hopkins? You are late."</p>

													<p>"Yes, I know I am. It's a wonder I could come at
														all," said Susy.</p>

													<p>"Ruth Craven hasn't come yet," said another voice.</p>

													<p>"Yes, here she is," cried a third, and Ruth came and
														stood at the edge of the patch of light.</p>

													<p>Kathleen flung off her hat, and the light from the
														lamps lit up her brilliant hair. Her cheeks were flaming
														with color, and her very dark-blue eyes looked as black as
														night. She faced her companions.</p>

													<p>"Well," she said, "here we are, and we call
														ourselves the Wild Irish Girls. I really wonder if you
														English girls who are assembled here in the old quarry
														to-night have the least idea what it means to be a wild
														Irish girl. If you don't know, I'd like to tell you."</p>

													<p>"Yes, do tell us," cried several.</p>

													<p>
														"The principal thing that it means," continued Kathleen,
														raising her voice to a slightly theatrical pitch, and
														extending her arm so that the lamplight fell all over
														it—"the chief thing that it means is to be free—yes, free
														as the
														<!-- Page 118 -->
														<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a> air, free as the
														mountain streams, free as the dear, darling, glorious,
														everlasting mountains themselves. Oh, to know freedom and
														then to be torn away from it! Girls, I will tell you the
														truth. I feel in your dull old England as though I were in
														prison. Yes, that's about it. I don't like England. I want
														you girls to join me in loving Ireland."
													</p>

													<p>"But we can't hate England," said Kate Rourke; "that
														is quite impossible. If Ireland is your native land,
														England is ours, and we cannot help loving her very, very
														much."</p>

													<p>
														"You have never known Ireland," continued Kathleen. "You
														are not cramped up in that favored spot; you are allowed
														to get up when you like and to go to bed when you like, to
														eat what you like, to read what books you like, to row on
														the lake, to shoot in the bogs, to gallop on your pony
														over the moors, and—and—oh, to live the life of the <i>free</i>."
													</p>

													<p>It was Ruth Craven who now interrupted the eager
														words of the queen of the new society.</p>

													<p>"Can't you tell us, Kathleen," she said, "how to get
														Ireland into England—how to introduce what is good of
														Ireland into England? That is the use of the society as
														far as I am concerned. With the exception of yourself we
														are all English girls."</p>

													<p>"Yes," said Susy suddenly; "and we have very bad
														times most of us. I wish you knew what a dull evening I
														have just been living through—taking care of a tiny, very
														dull little shop. Mother was out looking after a sick
														child, and I had to mind the shop. Poor women came in for
														penn'orths of paper. I can tell you there wasn't much
														freedom about that; it was all horrid."</p>

													<p>
														"Well, we have shops in Ireland too," continued Kath
														<!-- Page 119 -->
														<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>leen, "and I suppose
														people have to mind them. But what I want to say now is
														this. I have been sent over to this country to learn. My
														aunt Katie O'Flynn—she's the finest figure of a woman you
														ever laid eyes on—thought that I ought to have learning;
														mother thought so too, but the dad didn't much care.
														However, I needn't worry you about that. I have been sent
														here, and here I am. When I came to your wonderful school
														and looked all around me, I said to myself, 'If I'm not to
														have companions, why, I'll die; the heart of Kathleen
														O'Hara will be broken. Now, who amongst the schoolgirls
														will suit me? I saw that very dull Cassandra Weldon, and I
														noticed a few companions of hers who were much the same
														sort. Then I observed dear, pretty little Ruth Craven, and
														some one said to me, 'You won't take much notice of Ruth,
														for she's only a foundation girl.' That made me mad. Oh
														yes, it did—Give me your hand, Ruth.—That made my whole
														heart go out to Ruth. Then I was told that a lot of the
														girls were foundation girls, and they weren't as rich as
														the others, and they were somewhat snubbed. So I thought,
														'My time has come. I am an Irish girl, and the heritage of
														every Irish girl, handed down to her from a long line of
														ancestors, is to help the oppressed,' So now I am going to
														help all of you, and we are going to found this society,
														and we are going to have a good time."
													</p>

													<p>Kathleen's somewhat incoherent speech was received
														with shouts of applause.</p>

													<p>"We must make a few rules," she continued when her
														young companions had ceased to shout—"just a few big rules
														which will be quite easy for all of us to obey."</p>

													<p>"Certainly," said Kate. "And I have brought a
														note-book with me, and if you will dictate them, Kathleen,
														I will jot them down."</p>

													<p>
														<!-- Page 120 -->
														<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>"That is easy
														enough," said Kathleen. "Well, I am queen."
													</p>

													<p>"Certainly you are!" "Who else could be?" "Of course
														you are queen!" "Darling!" "Dear!" "Sweet!" "Duck!" fell
														from various pairs of lips.</p>

													<p>"Thank you," said Kathleen, looking round at them,
														her dark-blue eyes becoming dewy with a sudden emotion. "I
														think," she added, "I love you all already, and there is
														nothing on earth I wouldn't do for you."</p>

													<p>"Hear her, the dear! She is bringing a fine change
														into our lives, cried a mass of girls who stood a little
														out of the line of light.</p>

													<p>"Well," said Kathleen, "I am queen, and I have my
														Cabinet. Now the girls of my Cabinet are the following:
														Ruth Craven is my Prime Minister; Kate Rourke comes next
														in importance; then follow Susy Hopkins, Clara Sawyer,
														Hannah Johnson, Rosy Myers, and Mary Rand. Now all of you
														girls whom I have named are expected to uphold order—such
														order as is alone necessary for the Wild Irish Girls. You
														are expected on all occasions to uphold the authority of
														me, your queen. You are never under any circumstances to
														breathe a word against dear old Ireland. The other girls
														who join the society will be looked after by you; you will
														instruct them in our rules, and you will help them to be
														good members of a most important society. I believe there
														are a great many girls willing to join. If so, will they
														hold up their hands?"</p>

													<p>Immediately a great show of hands was visible.</p>

													<p>"Now, Kate Rourke," cried Kathleen, "please take
														down the names of the girls who intend to become members
														of the Wild Irish Girls."</p>

													<p>
														The girls came forward one by one, and Kate took down
														their names; and it was quickly discovered that, out of
														<!-- Page 121 -->
														<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a> the hundred
														foundationers who belonged to the Great Shirley School,
														sixty had joined Kathleen's society.
													</p>

													<p>"We shall soon get the remaining forty," said Mary
														Rand. "They will be all agog to come on. Their positions
														are not so very pleasant as it is, poor things!"</p>

													<p>"Perhaps sixty are about as many as we can manage
														for the present," said Kathleen. "Now, girls, I intend to
														present you each with a tiny badge. I have a bag full of
														them here. Will you each come forward and accept the badge
														of membership?"</p>

													<p>Kathleen's badges were very much admired, the eager
														girls bending down towards the light of the lamps in order
														to examine them more thoroughly. She had strung narrow
														green ribbon through each of the little silver hearts, and
														the girls could therefore slip them over their heads at
														once.</p>

													<p>"You must hide them," said Kathleen. "The thing
														about these badges is that you will always feel them
														pressing against your hearts, and nobody else will know
														anything about them. They belong to Ireland and to me—to
														the home of the free and to Kathleen O'Hara. They seal you
														as my loving friends and followers for ever and ever."</p>

													<p>
														Girls are easily impressed, and Kathleen's words were so
														fervent that some of them felt quite choky about the
														throat. They received their badges with hands that very
														nearly trembled. Kathleen next handed a slightly handsomer
														badge, but with exactly the same device, to the members of
														her Cabinet. Finally, she took the box of pale-blue
														cashmere blouses and opened it in the light of the lamps.
														The enthusiasm, which had been extremely keen before the
														appearance of the blouses, now rose to fever-height. Whom
														were these exquisite creations meant for? Kathleen smiled
														as she handed one to Mary Rand, another
														<!-- Page 122 -->
														<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a> to Ruth Craven,
														another to Kate Rourke, and finally to each member of her
														Cabinet.
													</p>

													<p>
														"I wish I could give you all a blouse apiece," she said to
														the other girls of the society, "but I am afraid that is
														not within my means. I chose these sweet blouses on
														purpose, because I know you could wear them at any time,
														girls," she added, turning to the members of her Cabinet.
														"Outsiders won't know. They will wonder at the beauty of
														your dress, but they won't know what it means; but <i>we</i>
														will know," she shouted aloud to her companions—"we will
														know that these girls belong to us and to old Ireland, and
														in particular to me, and they will be faithful to me as
														their queen."
													</p>

													<p>"Oh dear," said little Alice Harding, a pale-faced
														girl, who loved fine dress and never could aspire to it,
														"what means can I take to become a member of the Cabinet?"</p>

													<p>"By being a very good outside member, and trusting
														to your luck," laughed Kathleen. "But the time is passing,
														and we must proceed to what little business is left for
														to-night."</p>

													<p>Each member of the Cabinet took possession of her
														own blouse, wrapped it up tenderly, and tucked it under
														her arm. Kathleen desired some one to throw the tell-tale
														box away, and then she collected her followers round her.</p>

													<p>
														"Now," she said, <i>"Rule One</i>. To stick through thick
														and thin each to the other."
													</p>

													<p>"Yes!" cried every voice.</p>

													<p>
														<i>"Rule Two.</i> If possible, never to quarrel each with
														the other."
													</p>

													<p>This rule also was received with acclamations.</p>

													<p>
														<i>"Rule Three.</i> To have a bit of fun all to ourselves
														at least once a week."
													</p>

													<p>
														This rule quite "brought down the house." They
														<!-- Page 123 -->
														<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a> shouted so loud that
														if the spot had been less lonely some one would certainly
														have taken cognizance of their proceedings.
													</p>

													<p>
														<i>"Rule Four.</i> That as far as possible we hold
														ourselves aloof from the paying members of the Great
														Shirley School."
													</p>

													<p>This rule was not quite as enthusiastically
														received. The foundationers were not altogether without
														friends amongst the other girls of the school. Ruth Craven
														in particular had several.</p>

													<p>"I don't think that is a very fair rule," she said.
														"I am fond of Alice Tennant, and I am fond of Cassandra
														Weldon."</p>

													<p>"And I care for Lucy Sharp"; "And I am devoted to
														Amelia Dawson," said other members of the Cabinet.</p>

													<p>Nevertheless Kathleen was firm.</p>

													<p>"The rule must be held," she said. "In a society
														like ours there are always rules which are not quite
														agreeable to every one. My principal object in starting
														this society is to put those horrid paying girls in their
														proper places. There must not be friendship—not real
														friendship, I mean—between us and them."</p>

													<p>"You are a paying girl yourself," suddenly exclaimed
														Mary Rand.</p>

													<p>"I know. I wish I were not, but I can't help myself.
														You must allow me to stand alone; I am your queen."</p>

													<p>"That you are, and I love you," said Mary.</p>

													<p>"This rule must hold good," repeated Kathleen. "I
														must insist on my society adhering to it.—Ruth Craven, why
														are you silent?"</p>

													<p>"Because I earnestly wish I had not joined. I cannot
														give up Cassandra, nor Alice, nor—nor other girls."</p>

													<p>
														"Nonsense, Ruth! You dare not fail me now," said
														<!-- Page 124 -->
														<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a> Kathleen, with
														enthusiasm. "I will make it up to you. You shall come with
														me to Ireland in the summer. You shall. Oh Ruth, don't
														fail me!"
													</p>

													<p>"I won't; but I hate that rule."</p>

													<p>"And, girls, I think we must part now," said Kate
														Rourke. "It is getting late, and it would never do for our
														secret meetings to be discovered."</p>

													<p>"Whatever happens, we must stick together," said
														Kathleen. "Well, good-night; we meet again this day week."</p>

													<p>There was quite a flutter of excitement along that
														lonely road as the Wild Irish Girls returned to their
														different homes. Susy Hopkins felt quite the happiest and
														most light-hearted of any. By-and-by she and Ruth Craven
														found themselves the only girls who were walking down the
														road called Southwood Lane. This road led right into the
														centre of the shops where Susy's mother lived.</p>

													<p>"What a good thing," said Susy, "that I took the
														latchkey with me! It is past ten o'clock. Mother would be
														wild if she had to sit up so late."</p>

													<p>Ruth was silent.</p>

													<p>"Aren't you happy, Ruthie? Don't you think it is all
														splendid?" cried Susy.</p>

													<p>"Yes and no," said Ruth. "You see, I am a
														foundationer, and when she pressed me to join I hated not
														to; but now I am sorry that I have joined. What am I to do
														about Cassandra and about Alice?"</p>

													<p>"You think a great deal about Cassandra, don't you?"</p>

													<p>"Oh, yes; she is quite a splendid girl, and she has
														been so very good to me."</p>

													<p>"I suppose you are quite in love with her?"</p>

													<p>"No, I don't think I am. It isn't my way to fall
														violently in love with girls, like some of the rest of
														you. But I like her; and I like Alice Tennant."</p>

													<p>
														<!-- Page 125 -->
														<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>"All the same," said
														Susy, "it is worth sacrificing a little thing to belong to
														the Wild Irish Girls. Did you ever in all your life see
														any one look more splendid than Kathleen as she stood with
														the light of those big lamps upon her? She is a wonderful
														girl—so graceful, and with such a power of eloquence. And
														she has such a way of just taking you by storm; and her
														language is so poetic. Oh, I adore her! She is the sort of
														girl that I could die for. If all Irish girls are like
														her, Ireland must be a wonderful country to live in."
													</p>

													<p>"But they are not," said Ruth. "Half of them are
														quite commonplace. She happens to be rich and beautiful,
														and to have a taking way; but all the others are not like
														her, I am certain of it."</p>

													<p>"Anyhow, whether they are or not, I am glad to
														belong to the society," said Susy. "It will give us great
														fun, and we need not mind now whether the paying girls are
														disagreeable to us or not. Then, too, think of the blouses
														we have got. Oh dear! oh dear! when I put mine on on
														Sunday mother will gape. I shall feel proud of myself in
														it. It was just sweet of her to get things like this to
														give us. And she knew we weren't well off. Oh, I do think
														she's one in a thousand! She must have thought of you,
														Ruth, when she ordered these sweet pale-blue colors, for
														that color is yours, isn't it?"</p>

													<p>"I suppose so," said Ruth. "Well, all the same, I
														feel rather anxious. I like her, of course, but I think
														she is mistaken. I must go on now, but I feel somehow——"</p>

													<p>"What?" said Susy, with some impatience.</p>

													<p>"As though I had not done right—as though I had
														something to conceal. Well, I can't help myself, only I
														won't hate the girls who are good to me. Good-night, Susy.
														We won't be in time for school in the morning if we stay
														talking any longer."</p>

														<h3>THE BLOUSE AND THE ROBBERY.</h3>


														<p>Susy Hopkins shared none of Ruth Craven's scruples.
															To her the Wild Irish Girls' Society was all that was
															lovely. She trod on air as she went down the street, and
															when she finally let herself into her mother's little
															shop, locked the door after her, and went softly
															upstairs, her heart was beating so loud that she hardly
															knew herself. She slept in a tiny room just at the back
															of her mother's; it was sparsely furnished, and had a
															sloping roof at one side. The chest of drawers also did
															duty as a dressing-table, and there was a small square of
															looking-glass placed on the top. Susy had secured a
															candle in a tin candlestick, with which she had lighted
															herself to her bedroom, but when she got there she had no
															intention of putting up with such feeble illumination.
															She first of all drew the bolt to secure herself against
															intrusion, and then stepping on tiptoe, she unlocked a
															drawer and took from it several ends of candle which she
															had collected from time to time. These she stuck on the
															dressing-table, and when she had made her little garret
															almost as bright as day she unfolded her pale-blue
															blouse. She bent low over her treasure, examining the
															blue embroidery, which was rendered still more
															fascinating with small stitches of pink silk, looking
															with ecstacy at the real lace round the neck and cuffs
															and finally pressing the delicate color against her
															blooming cheek.</p>

														<p>
															Susy Hopkins was quite an ordinary-looking little girl.
															Her nose was decidedly snub, her mouth wide; but her eyes
															were dark and bright, and she had fairly good eye
															<!-- Page 127 -->
															<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>brows. She had a low
															forehead, rather nice curly hair, and a high color in her
															cheeks.
														</p>

														<p>"In this blouse I shall look a positive beauty,"
															she thought. "Won't Tom respect me when he sees me in it
															on Sunday? I must try it on now; I really must."</p>

														<p>Accordingly she slipped off her bodice, and
															substituted the pale-blue cashmere blouse for the ugly
															and threadbare garment she had removed. Whether the
															blouse was becoming to Susy Hopkins or not remains to be
															proved, but it certainly delighted its wearer, causing
															her eyes to sparkle and the color in her cheeks to grow
															brighter.</p>

														<p>"It is the most beautiful thing I ever saw in my
															life," she thought. "Why, Kathleen is like a fairy
															godmother. And how well it fits! And what a perfect cut
															about the neck! And, oh! these darling little cuffs at
															the end of the sleeves, and this sweet pink embroidery
															and this little ruffle of lace round the neck. Oh! there
															never, never was anything made so beautifully before. I
															am in luck; I am—I am."</p>

														<p>Her mother's hand knocking on the wall brought her
															down from the clouds.</p>

														<p>"Go to bed, dear," called out her parent. "It is
															very late, and you are disturbing me."</p>

														<p>"Yes, mother," called back Susy.</p>

														<p>She removed the blouse, folded it in tissue-paper,
															put it into her drawer, blew out the candles, and got
															into bed. But all through the remainder of the night Susy
															dreamt of her blouse. The blouse filled her thoughts,
															otherwise she might have been in raptures over her pretty
															silver locket and its green ribbon. But as this was for
															private wear, and must on no account be shown to any one
															who was not a member of the society, it did not give her
															the amount of rapture it would otherwise have done.</p>

														<p>
															"It is lovely too. It is a badge, and means a great
															deal,"
															<!-- Page 128 -->
															<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a> she said to
															herself, and she closed her hand over it as she lay in
															bed. "It is tiresome that I cannot show it. It is a sweet
															little locket, and I might save up money enough to have
															it gilded over. People would think I had a gold locket. I
															have always nearly died to have one; but of course I
															couldn't do that, for it would displease our queen, the
															darling, and I wouldn't for all I am worth do anything to
															annoy her. Oh dear, things are turning out lovely! I am
															twice as happy a girl as I was before Kathleen O'Hara
															came to the school."
														</p>

														<p>At school next day the members of the new society
															looked a little conscious. Their eyes often met, and
															those eyes spoke volumes. Sometimes a girl would put her
															hand up to her neck in a somewhat significant way, and
															another girl would respond with a similar signal. There
															was a sort of suppressed excitement in the school; but
															the teachers remarked nothing. On the contrary, they were
															pleased with the way lessons were done, exercises gone
															through, and work accomplished. The girls were so
															completely in league with each other, so full of delight
															over the new amusement which Kathleen had started in
															their midst, that they had no time to be supercilious or
															disagreeable to the paying girls, who were left in peace.
															They were usually a good deal tormented by the
															foundationers, who took their revenge by small spiteful
															ways—by taking the ink when they did not want it, by
															removing good pens and putting bad ones in their places,
															by spilling ink on the blotting paper. In short, they had
															many ways of rendering the life of a paying girl anything
															but happy. To-day, however, all was peace and quiet.
															Kathleen walked in her radiant fashion through her
															lessons; her beautiful face could not but be an
															attraction. She was very bright and very smart, and even
															Alice gave her an approving glance.</p>

														<p>
															<!-- Page 129 -->
															<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>"Mother is right,"
															she thought. "She is a little better than she was. If
															only she would take a real interest in her work I should
															have hopes of her."
														</p>

														<p>Now Cassandra Weldon had come to the school that
															day with the intention of asking Ruth Craven to come home
															with her. She had a suggestion to make to Ruth. She knew
															that the little girl was very poor and very clever.
															Cassandra was working very hard for one of the big
															scholarships, and her mother had gone to the expense of
															getting a special coach to help her at home. Cassandra
															had spoken to her mother, and her mother had agreed that
															Ruth might come back with her each evening and also take
															advantage of the services of Miss Renshaw. If Ruth got a
															scholarship she would indeed be a happy girl, and it was
															Cassandra's, opinion that, although she had been such a
															short time in the school, she would have a very good
															chance if she got a little outside help.</p>

														<p>Accordingly Cassandra waited for Ruth outside the
															school when lessons were over. During the morning her
															eyes had travelled in Ruth's direction pretty often, and
															her eyes had conveyed to the little girl all sorts of
															kind and friendly messages. But Ruth had avoided
															Cassandra's eyes. She had made up her mind.</p>

														<p>"I can't be two things," she said to herself. "I
															have elected to go with the foundationers and with
															Kathleen O'Hara, although I don't care for the society,
															and I don't want to belong to the girls who band
															themselves together against the paying girls. But if I do
															this I certainly can't take advantage of Cassandra's
															kindness. I do love her—I am sure I should love her
															dearly—but I can't have much to say to her now."</p>

														<p>
															Accordingly, while Cassandra waited for Ruth, hoping that
															she would appear at any moment, and that she could
															<!-- Page 130 -->
															<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a> tell her what a
															good thing she had arranged on her behalf, Ruth avoided
															Cassandra. Presently Kathleen O'Hara, dressed somewhat
															extravagantly, and with her blue velvet cap perched upon
															the back of her golden hair, strolled out of school. She
															had a crimson sash round her black velvet dress, and a
															wide lace collar encircled her neck. She was fastening a
															heavily embroidered coat of blue cashmere when Cassandra
															accosted her.
														</p>

														<p>"How do you do, Miss O'Hara?" she said.</p>

														<p>"How are you?" replied Kathleen, just raising her
															brows, and then turning to say something to Susy Hopkins.</p>

														<p>Cassandra frowned.</p>

														<p>"How can Kathleen, who with all her eccentricities
															is a lady, waste her time talking to an insignificant
															little girl like Susy?" thought Cassandra.</p>

														<p>Kathleen seemed to read her neighbor's thoughts,
															for she slipped her hand inside Susy's arm.</p>

														<p>"I will walk with you a little way," she said; "I
															have something I want to say."</p>

														<p>"One moment first," said Cassandra. "Have you seen
															Ruth Craven anywhere?"</p>

														<p>"Oh yes; Ruth has left the school. Didn't you see
															her go? There she is, crossing the field. I suppose she
															is in a hurry to get home."</p>

														<p>"Thank you," said Cassandra.</p>

														<p>She caught up her books and started running in the
															direction of Ruth Craven.</p>

														<p>"How tiresome of her to have gone so fast!" she
															said to herself?</p>

														<p>Presently she shouted Ruth's name, and Ruth was
															obliged to stop.</p>

														<p>
															"Why, Ruth," said Cassandra, "what is the matter with
															<!-- Page 131 -->
															<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a> you? You generally
															wait to talk to me after school is over. Why are you in
															such a hurry?"
														</p>

														<p>"I am not," said Ruth, who was not going to get out
															of her difficulty by telling an untruth.</p>

														<p>"Well, if you are not in a hurry, why are you
															running across this field at the rate of a hunt? It looks
															as if you were—" Cassandra paused, and the color came
															into her cheeks—"as if you were running away from me."</p>

														<p>Ruth was silent. Cassandra came close to her and
															looked into her face.</p>

														<p>"What is the matter, Ruth?" she repeated.</p>

														<p>"I have promised granny that I would help her with
															some darning this afternoon."</p>

														<p>"Your granny must do without you, for you have got
															to come back with me."</p>

														<p>"Oh, indeed, I can't!"</p>

														<p>"But you must, my little girl. I have got the most
															heavenly plan to suggest to you."</p>

														<p>Cassandra laid her hand on Ruth's shoulder. Ruth
															started away.</p>

														<p>"What is it, Ruth? How queer you look! What is the
															matter?"</p>

														<p>"I must get home. I promised granny."</p>

														<p>"But listen before you decide. You know Miss
															Renshaw, don't you?"</p>

														<p>"Miss Maria Renshaw, the coach. Yes, I do."</p>

														<p>"Don't you remember my pointing her out to you?"</p>

														<p>"Of course I remember it, Cassandra; and she
															looked—oh, lovely!"</p>

														<p>
															"She is far more lovely than she looks—that is, if you
															mean she is clever and taking and all the rest. She is
															just perfectly splendid. She makes you see a thing at the
															first glance. She has a way of putting information into
															you
															<!-- Page 132 -->
															<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a> so that you cannot
															help knowing. Oh, she is delightful! And mother says that
															I may have her to coach me for the big scholarship—the
															sixty-pounds-a-year scholarship. You know there are two
															of them. There is one quite in your line, and there is
															one in mine; and there is no earthly reason why you
															should not get one and I the other."
														</p>

														<p>"Well?" said Ruth.</p>

														<p>Her beautiful, fair, delicately chiselled face had
															turned pale. She stood very upright, and looked full at
															Cassandra.</p>

														<p>"It could be easily done, dear little Ruth. Miss
															Renshaw would just as soon coach two girls as one, and
															mother has arranged it. Yes, she has arranged it
															absolutely. Miss Renshaw will coach you and me together.
															You are to come home with me every evening. She will give
															us both an hour. Isn't it too splendid?"</p>

														<p>Ruth did not speak.</p>

														<p>"Aren't you pleased, Ruth? Don't you think it is
															very nice of me to think of my friends? You are my
															friend, you know."</p>

														<p>"Oh no," said Ruth.</p>

														<p>"But what is it? What is the matter?"</p>

														<p>"I—I can't."</p>

														<p>"You can. It will be madness to refuse. Think what
															a chance is offered you. If you get Miss Renshaw's
															instruction you are safe to get that scholarship; and it
															is for three years, Ruth. It would send you, with a
															little help from your grandfather, perhaps to Holloway
															College, perhaps to Somerville or Newnham, or even
															Girton. Perhaps you could try for a scholarship in one of
															these great colleges afterwards. You daren't refuse it.
															It means—oh, it means all the difference in your whole
															life."</p>

														<p>
															"I know," said Ruth. "Cassandra, I will write to you. I
															can't decide just now. I am awfully obliged to you; I
															<!-- Page 133 -->
															<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a> can't express what
															I feel. You are good; you are very, very good."
														</p>

														<p>Ruth caught one of Cassandra's hands and raised it
															to her lips.</p>

														<p>"You are very good," she said again.</p>

														<p>Meanwhile Kathleen O'Hara, after walking a very
															short way with Susy Hopkins, gave her an abrupt good-bye
															and started running in the direction of the Tennants'
															house. She did not care a bit for Susy; but being a
															member of the Wild Irish Girls, and not only a member,
															but one of the Cabinet, she must on all occasions be kind
															to her. Nevertheless a commonplace little girl like Susy
															Hopkins had not one thing in common with Kathleen.</p>

														<p>
															"Everything is going splendidly," she said to herself.
															"No fear now that I shall not have plenty of excitement
															in the coming by-and-by. I mean to write to father and
															ask him whether I may not invite some of the members of
															the Cabinet to Carrigrohane. Wouldn't they enjoy it? Kate
															Rourke, of course, must come; and dear little Ruth
															Craven. How pale and sweet Ruth looked to-day! She is far
															and away the nicest girl in the school. I am so glad I
															have taken steps to prevent that horrid friendship with
															Cassandra coming to anything! Ruth mustn't love anybody
															in the school very, <i>very</i> much except me. Oh,
															things are going well, and Alice little guesses what she
															is driving me to by her extraordinary behavior."
														</p>

														<p>Kathleen entered the house, banging the door loudly
															after her, as was her fashion.</p>

														<p>Another little girl had also reached home, but she
															did not bang the door. She entered her mother's shop to
															encounter the flushed and much-perturbed face of her
															parent.</p>

														<p>"Well, Susy," said Mrs. Hopkins, "I wouldn't have
															thought it of you."</p>

														<p>
															<!-- Page 134 -->
															<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>"Why, what is it,
															mother?"
														</p>

														<p>"There's nineteen-and-sixpence taken out of the
															till," said Mrs. Hopkins. "Some one must have come into
															the shop, for the accounts are nineteen-and-sixpence
															short. When I left the house yesterday there were three
															pounds in the till—three pounds and fivepence-halfpenny.
															You sold, according to your own showing, a penn'orth of
															paper, which makes an extra penny; but when I went into
															the accounts this morning I found that the whole amount
															was only two pounds one shilling and a halfpenny.
															Nineteen-and-sixpence is missing. Susy, what does this
															mean?"</p>

														<p>"I am sure, mother, I can't tell you. No one came
															into the shop; certainly no one stole the money."</p>

														<p>"My dear child, seeing is believing. I assure you
															there are only two pounds one shilling and a halfpenny in
															the till. I scarcely took a penny this morning, and that
															nineteen-and-sixpence makes it impossible for me to pay
															my rent, as I meant to do, to-day. Who can have come in
															and stolen very nearly a pound's worth of my hard-earned
															money?"</p>

														<p>"Nobody, mother dear. Do let me examine the till."</p>

														<p>"Are you quite positive that no one came into the
															shop?"</p>

														<p>"Nobody, mother."</p>

														<p>"You did not leave the shop even for a moment?"</p>

														<p>"Yes; I went to sit in the parlor."</p>

														<p>"Oh, Susy? there you are! I trust you with my house
															and property, and you leave the shop without any one in
															it Did you lock the till?"</p>

														<p>Susy had an unpleasant memory of having found the
															till open when she returned to attend to a customer.</p>

														<p>"No" she said, hanging her head.</p>

														<p>Mrs. Hopkins uttered a heavy sigh.</p>

														<p>
															"Oh, dear!" she said. "And as you sat in the parlor
															<!-- Page 135 -->
															<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a> you could see the
															shop. You did not leave the parlor, did you?"
														</p>

														<p>For one minute Susy remembered that she had gone
															upstairs for an exercise-book, but she determined not to
															tell her mother of this further enormity.</p>

														<p>"I was either in the shop or in the parlor all the
															time. I only went into the parlor because I could not do
															my exercises in the shop. But I sat where I could see
															everything."</p>

														<p>"You couldn't have done so. This money would not
															have gone without hands. How am I to manage I don't know.
															I have lost a large sum for such a poor woman."</p>

														<p>Susy pitied her mother, tried to assure her that
															the fault was not hers, was convinced that the money
															would be found, and went on talking a lot of nonsense
															until Mrs. Hopkins fairly lost her temper.</p>

														<p>"Examine the drawer for yourself" she said. "I
															tell, you what it is, Susy, I won't be able to buy you a
															new winter frock at all this year; and you will have to
															have your boots patched, for I can't afford a new pair. I
															was trying to collect a pound towards your winter things,
															but this puts a stop to everything."</p>

														<p>"Mother doesn't know what a lovely blouse I've
															got," thought Susy. "When she sees me in that she'll be
															quite cheered up."</p>

														<p>The moment she thought of the blouse the little
															girl felt a frantic desire to run upstairs to look at it.</p>

														<p>
															"Mother," she said, "I don't mind a bit about the winter
															dress; and if my boots are neatly patched and well
															blacked every day, I dare say I can do with them a little
															longer. And I will sit with you this afternoon, mother,
															and help you to sew. I can't understand who could have
															stolen the money. Perhaps it is a practical joke of
															Tom's;
															<!-- Page 136 -->
															<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a> you know he is fond
															of doing things of that sort now and then."
														</p>

														<p>"No, it isn't, for I asked him. Who can have come
															into the shop? Do you think you fell asleep over your
															work?"</p>

														<p>"Oh, no."</p>

														<p>"Then it is a mystery past bearing. If nobody came
															in, and you never left either the shop or the parlor,
															that money was taken out of the till as though by magic."</p>

														<p>"We will find it, mother; we are sure to find it,"
															said Susy; and the way she said these words aggravated
															poor Mrs. Hopkins, as she said afterwards, more than a
															little.</p>

															<h3>TOM HOPKINS AND HIS WAY WITH AUNT CHURCH.</h3>


															<p>
																It was quite true that Mrs. Hopkins could ill afford to
																lose so large a sum as nineteen-and-sixpence out of her
																small earnings. During her husband's lifetime the
																stationer's shop had gone well and provided a
																comfortable living for his wife, son, and daughter. But
																unfortunately, in an evil moment he had been induced to
																put his hand to a bill for a friend. The friend had, as
																usually is the case, become bankrupt. Poor Hopkins had
																to pay the money, and from that moment the affairs in
																the stationer's shop were the reverse of flourishing. In
																fact, the blow killed the poor man. He lingered for a
																time, broken-hearted and unable to rouse himself, and
																finally died about about three years before the date of
																this story. For a time Mrs. Hopkins was quite prostrate,
																but being a woman with a good deal of vigor and
																determination, she induced one of her relatives to lend
																her one hundred pounds, and
																<!-- Page 137 -->
																<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a> determined to keep
																on with the shop. She could not, of course, stock it as
																fully as she would have liked; she could never extend
																her connection beyond mere stationery, sealing-wax,
																pens, and a very few books, and Christmas cards in the
																winter. Still, she managed to support herself and Tom
																and Susy; but it was a scraping along all the time. She
																had to count every penny, and, above all things, to
																avoid going in debt. She was only in debt for the one
																hundred pounds, which had been lent to her by an aunt of
																her husband's, an old woman of the name of Church, who
																lived in a neighboring village about four miles away.
															</p>

															<p>Mrs. Church was quite rich, according to the
																Hopkinses' ideas of wealth. She lived alone and hoarded
																her money. She had not been at all willing to lend Mrs.
																Hopkins the hundred pounds; but as she had really been
																fond of Mr. Hopkins, and had at one time meant to make
																him her heir, she had listened to Mrs. Hopkins's
																lamentations, and desired her to send Tom to her to
																inspect him, and had finally handed over the money,
																which was to be paid back by monthly installments within
																the space of three years.</p>

															<p>
																Mrs. Hopkins was so relieved to get the money that she
																never thought at all of the terrible tax it would be to
																return it. Still, by working hard morning, noon, and
																night—she added to her gains by doing fine needlework
																for several ladies, who said that no one could embroider
																like Mrs. Hopkins—she managed to make two ends just meet
																together, and she always continued to send Mrs. Church
																her two pounds fifteen shillings and sevenpence on the
																first of every month. Tom was the one who generally ran
																across to the old lady's with the money; and so fond was
																she of him that she often gave him a piece of cake, and
																even on one or two rare occasions kept him to dinner.
																Tom enjoyed his visits to Mrs. Church, and Mrs. Hopkins
																<!-- Page 138 -->
																<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a> was sure to
																encourage him to go to her, as she hoped against hope
																that when the old lady died Tom would be left some of
																her money.
															</p>

															<p>It was on a Wednesday that Susy sat in the parlor
																and forgot all about the interests of the shop; it was
																on that very night that the tramp had come in and helped
																himself to a ten-shilling-piece and some silver out of
																the till; and it was on the following Saturday that Mrs.
																Hopkins, for the first time since she had borrowed the
																hundred pounds from Aunt Church, as she called the old
																lady, found that she could not return even a portion of
																what had just fallen due. She called Tom to her side.</p>

															<p>"Tom," she said, "you must go and see Aunt Church
																this afternoon as soon as ever you come in. You must go,
																and you must tell her."</p>

															<p>"Of course I'll go, mother," answered the boy. "I
																always like going to Aunt Church's; she is very kind to
																me. She said next time I came along she'd show me things
																in her microscope. She has got a beetle's wing, mother,
																mounted on glass, and when you gaze down at it it seems
																to be covered with beautiful feathers, as long as though
																they were on a big bird. And she has got a drop of water
																full of wriggly things all alive; and she says we drink
																it by the gallon, and it is no wonder we feel bad in our
																insides. I'll go, right enough. I suppose you have the
																money ready?"</p>

															<p>
																"No, Tom, that's just what I have not got. I told you
																how that night when I had the misfortune to go and see
																your aunt and look after her sick child, some one came
																into the shop and stole nineteen-and-sixpence out of the
																till. I am so short from the loss of that money that I
																can't pay Aunt Church for at least another week. Ask her
																if she'll be kind enough to give me a week's grace,
																<!-- Page 139 -->
																<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a> Tom; that's a good
																boy. I can't think how the money was stolen."
															</p>

															<p>"Why don't you put it into the hands of the
																police?" said Tom.</p>

															<p>"Why, Tom," said his mother, looking at him with
																admiration, "you are a smart boy. Do you know, I never
																thought of that. I will go round to the police-station
																this very afternoon and get Police-Constable Macartney
																to take it up."</p>

															<p>"But, mother, the thief, whoever he is, has left
																the place long before now. The money was stolen on
																Wednesday, and this is Saturday morning."</p>

															<p>"Well, Tom, there's no saying. Anyhow, I will go
																round to the police-station and lodge the information."</p>

															<p>Accordingly, while Susy was again trying on her
																lovely pale-blue cashmere blouse behind locked doors
																upstairs, Tom and his mother were plotting how best to
																cover the loss of the nineteen-and-sixpence. Naughty
																Susy, having made up her mind to deny herself a new
																frock and new boots, had given the matter no further
																consideration. She was accustomed to the fact that her
																mother was always in money difficulties. As long as she
																could remember, this was the state of things at home.
																She had come to the conclusion that grown-up persons
																were always in a frantic state about money, and she had
																no desire to join these anxious ones herself. As she
																could not mend matters, she did not see why she should
																worry about them.</p>

															<p>
																Tom had a scrap of dinner and then ran off to see Aunt
																Church. He found the old lady sitting at her parlor
																window looking out as usual for him. She was dressed in
																rusty black; she had a front of stiff curls on her
																forehead, a white widow's-cap over it, and a small black
																crape handkerchief crossed on her breast. Mrs. Church
																was a
																<!-- Page 140 -->
																<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a> little woman; she
																had very tiny feet and hands, and was very proud of
																them. She never thought of buying any new clothes, and
																her black bombazine dress was more brown than black now;
																so was her shawl, and so was the handkerchief which she
																wore round her neck. Her cap was tied with ribbons which
																had been washed so often that they were no longer white,
																but yellow.
															</p>

															<p>She came to the door to greet Tom when he arrived,
																and called him in.</p>

															<p>"Ah, Tom!" she said, "I have got a piece of
																plumcake waiting for you; and if you are a really good
																boy, and will shoo the fowls into my backyard and shut
																the gate on them, you may look into my microscope."</p>

															<p>"Thank you, Aunt Church," said Tom. "Shall I go at
																once and shoo the fowls?"</p>

															<p>"You had best give me my money first. Here is the
																box; you drop it in: two pounds in gold—I hope to
																goodness your mother has sent the money in gold—two
																pounds in gold and the rest in silver. Now then, here is
																the box. Drop it in like a good child, and then you
																shall shoo the fowls, and have your plumcake, and look
																in the microscope."</p>

															<p>"But, Aunt Church—" said Tom. He planted himself
																right in front of the old lady. He was a tall boy, well
																set up, with a sandy head, and a face covered with
																freckles. He had rather shallow blue eyes and a wide
																mouth, but his whole expression was honest and full of
																fun. "I am desperately sorry, and so is mother."</p>

															<p>"Eh! What?" said the old lady. She put her hand to
																her ear. "I am a bit hard of hearing, my dear; come
																close to me."</p>

															<p>"Mother's awfully sorry, but she can't pay you
																to-day."</p>

															<p>
																"Oh!" said Mrs. Church; "can't pay me to-day! But
																<!-- Page 141 -->
																<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a> it's the first of
																the month, and she was never behindhand—I will say
																that—in her payments before."
															</p>

															<p>"She's fretting past bearing," said Tom. "She'd
																give all the world to be able to pay you up, but she
																ain't got the money, and that's a fact. We have had a
																robbery in the shop, Aunt Church, and mother has took on
																dreadful."</p>

															<p>"A burglary?" said Mrs. Church. "Now tell me all
																about it. Stand here and pour your words into my ear. I
																am very much interested about burglaries. Was there
																attempted murder? Speak up, boy—speak up."</p>

															<p>Tom quite longed to say that there was. Had he
																been able to assure Mrs. Church that burglars with masks
																on their faces had burst into the shop at dead of night
																and penetrated to his mother's bedroom, and had held
																pistols to her throat and Susy's throat, and a great
																bare, glittering knife to his; and had he been further
																able to tell her that he himself, unaided, had grappled
																with the enemy, had wrested the knife from the hand of
																one, and knocked the loaded pistols from the hands of
																the others—then, indeed, he would have felt himself a
																hero, and the mere fact of not being able to return the
																money on the appointed day would not have signified.</p>

															<p>But Tom was truthful, and he had but a lame story
																to tell. Nineteen-and-sixpence had been abstracted from
																the till. Nobody knew how it had been done, and nobody
																had the least idea who was the thief. Mrs. Church, who
																would have given her niece unlimited time to return the
																money had there been a real, proper, bloodthirsty
																burglary, was not at all inclined to show mercy when the
																affair dwindled down into an unknown thief taking a
																small sum of money out of the till.</p>

															<p>
																"Why didn't you get it back?" she said. "Why didn't you
																send for the police? My word, this is a nice state of
																<!-- Page 142 -->
																<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a> things! And me to
																be out of my money that I counted upon. Why, Tom, boy, I
																spend that money on my food, rent, and the little
																expenses I have to go to. I made up my mind when I drew
																that hundred pounds from my dear husband's hard-earned
																savings that, whatever happened, I'd make that sum last
																me for all expenses for three years. And I have done it,
																Tom—I have done it. I am in low water, Tom. I want the
																money; I want it just as much as your poor mother does."
															</p>

															<p>"But you have money in the bank, haven't you?"</p>

															<p>"That is no affair of yours, Tom Hopkins. Don't
																talk in that silly way to me. No, I don't want you to
																shoo the fowls into the yard, and I don't mean to give
																you any plumcake. I shall have to eat it myself, for I
																have no money to buy anything else. And I won't show you
																the beautiful wings of the beetle in the microscope. You
																can go home to your mother and tell her I am very much
																annoyed indeed."</p>

															<p>"But, Aunt Church," said Tom, "if you were to see
																poor mother you wouldn't blame her. She looks, oh, so
																thin and so tired! She's terribly unhappy, and she will
																be certain sure to pay you next week. It was silly of
																her, I will own, not to think of the police sooner; but
																she's gone to them to-day, ordered by me to do that
																same."</p>

															<p>"That was thoughtful enough of you, Tom, and I
																don't object to giving you a morsel of the stalest cake.
																I always keep three cakes in three tin boxes, and you
																can have a morsel of the stalest; it is more than two
																months old, but you won't mind that."</p>

															<p>
																"Not me," said Tom, "I like stale cakes best," he added,
																determined to show his aunt that he was ready to be
																pleased with everything. He was a very knowing boy, and
																spoke up so well, and was so evidently sorry him
																<!-- Page 143 -->
																<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>self, and so
																positive that as soon as ever the police were told they
																would simply lay their hands on the thief and the thief
																would disgorge his spoils, that Aunt Church was fain to
																believe him.
															</p>

															<p>In the end she and he made a compact.</p>

															<p>"I tell you what it is," he said. "You haven't
																been to see mother for a long time, and if you ain't got
																any money to buy a dinner for yourself, it is but fair
																you should have a slice off our Sunday joint."</p>

															<p>"Sunday joint, indeed!" snapped Mrs. Church.</p>

															<p>"You couldn't expect us not to have a bit of meat
																on Sunday," said Tom. "Why, we'd get so weak that mother
																couldn't earn the money she sends you every month."</p>

															<p>"And you couldn't do your lessons and be the fine
																big boy that I am proud of," said Mrs. Church. "Now, to
																tell the truth, I can't bear that sister of yours—Susy,
																you call her—but I have a liking for you, Tom Hopkins.
																What is it you want me to do?"</p>

															<p>"If you will let me come here to-morrow, I'll push
																you all the way to Merrifield in time for our dinner.
																Wouldn't you like that? And I'd bring you back again in
																the evening. There's your own old bath-chair that Uncle
																Church used to be moved about in before he died."</p>

															<p>"To be sure, there is," said Mrs. Church, her eyes
																brightening. "But the lining has got moth-eaten."</p>

															<p>"Who minds that?" said Tom. "I'll go and clean it
																after you have given me that bit of cake you promised
																me."</p>

															<p>
																Everything ended quite satisfactorily as far as Tom was
																concerned, for Mrs. Church forgot her anger in the
																interest that the boy's visit gave her. She consulted
																him about her fowls, and gave him a new-laid egg to slip
																into his pocket for his own supper. Later on she allowed
																him to munch some very poor and very stale plumcake.
																Finally
																<!-- Page 144 -->
																<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a> she gave him his
																heart's delight, for he was allowed to peer into the old
																microscope and revel in the sight of the beetle's wings
																with thin, sweeping plumes, as he afterwards described
																them.
															</p>

															<p>It was rather late when Tom returned home. He
																burst into the parlor where his mother and Susy were
																sitting.</p>

															<p>"Mother," he said, "I have done everything
																splendidly; and she's coming to dine with us to-morrow."</p>

															<p>"She's what?" said Mrs. Hopkins.</p>

															<p>"Aunt Church is coming to dine with us. She was
																mad about the money, and nobody could have been nastier
																than she might have turned out but for me. But it's all
																right now. We must have a nice dinner for her. She is
																very fond of good things, and as she never gives them to
																herself, she will enjoy ours all the more."</p>

															<p>"She'll think that I am rich, when I am as poor as
																a church mouse," said Mrs. Hopkins. "But I suppose you
																have done everything for the best, Tom, and I must go
																around to the butcher's for a little addition to the
																dinner."</p>

															<p>Mrs. Hopkins left the house, and Tom sank into a
																chair by his sister.</p>

															<p>"It's golloptious for me," he said. "She's taking
																no end of a fancy to me. See this egg? She gave it to me
																for my supper. Mother shall have it. Mother is looking
																very white about the gills; a new-laid egg that she
																hasn't to pay for will nourish her up like anything."</p>

															<p>"So it will," said Susy. "We'll boil it and say
																nothing about it, and just pop it on her plate when
																she's having her supper. All the same, Tom, I wish you
																hadn't asked old Aunt Church here. She is such a queer
																old body; and the neighbors sometimes drop in on
																Sundays. And I have asked Miss Kathleen O'Hara to come
																in to-morrow, and she has promised to."</p>

															<p>
																<!-- Page 145 -->
																<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>"What?" said Tom.
																"That grand beauty of a young lady, the pride of the
																school? Why, everybody is talking about her. At the
																boys' school they've caught sight of her, and there
																isn't a boy that hasn't fallen in love with her. They
																all slink behind the wall, and bob up as she comes by.
																You don't mean that <i>she's</i> coming here?"
															</p>

															<p>"Yes; why not? She's very fond of me."</p>

															<p>"But she's no end of a howler. They say she's
																worth her weight in gold, and that her father is a sort
																of king in Ireland. Why should she take up with a little
																girl like you?"</p>

															<p>"Well, Tom, some people like me, although you
																think but little of your sister. Kathleen is very fond
																of me. I invited her to have tea with us to-morrow, and
																she is coming."</p>

															<p>"My word!" said Tom. "To think that I shall be
																sitting at the same table with her! I'll be able to make
																my own terms now with John Short and Harry Reid and the
																rest of the chaps. Why, Susy, you must be a genius, and
																I thought you weren't much of a sort."</p>

															<p>"I am better than you think; and she is fond of
																me."</p>

															<p>"And you really and truly call her by her
																Christian name?"</p>

															<p>"Of course I do."</p>

															<p>Susy longed to tell Tom about the wonderful
																society; but its strictest rule was that it was never to
																be spoken about to outsiders. Susy, as a member of the
																Cabinet, must certainly be one of the last to break the
																rules.</p>

															<p>Mrs. Hopkins came back at that moment. She had
																added a pound of sausage and a little piece of pork to
																their usual Sunday fare. She had also brought
																sixpennyworth of apples with her.</p>

															<p>
																<!-- Page 146 -->
																<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>"These are to make
																a pudding," she said. "I think we shall do now very
																well."
															</p>

															<p>Susy and Tom quite agreed with their mother. Susy
																rose and prepared supper, and at the crucial moment the
																new-laid egg was laid on Mrs. Hopkins's plate. It takes,
																perhaps, a great deal of poverty to truly appreciate a
																new-laid egg. Mrs. Hopkins was delighted with hers; she
																thought Tom the noblest boy in the world for having
																denied himself in order to give it to her. Tears filled
																her tired eyes as she thanked God for her good children.</p>

															<p>Susy and Tom watched her as she ate the egg, and
																thought how delicious it must taste, but were glad she
																had it.</p>

															<p>The following day dawned bright and clear, with a
																suspicion of frost in the air. It was, as Tom expressed
																it, a perfect day. Susy went to church with her mother
																in the morning, the dinner being all prepared and left
																to cook itself in the oven. Tom started at about eleven
																o'clock on his walk to the tiny village where Mrs.
																Church lived.</p>

															<p>As soon as Susy returned from her place of worship
																she helped her mother to get the little parlor ready.
																She put some autumn leaves in a jug on the center of the
																table. Her mother brought out the best china, which had
																not been used since her husband's death. The best china
																was very pretty, and Susy thought that no table could
																look more elegant than theirs. The best china was
																accompanied by some quite good knives and forks. The
																forks were real silver; Mrs. Hopkins regarded them with
																pride.</p>

															<p>
																"If the worst—the very worst—comes," she said to Susy,
																"we can sell them; but I cling to them as a piece of
																respectability that I never want to part from. Your
																<!-- Page 147 -->
																<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a> dear father gave
																them to me on our wedding-day—a whole dozen of beautiful
																silver forks with the hall-mark on them, and his
																initials on the handle of each. I want them to be Tom's
																some day. Silver should always be handed on to the
																eldest son."
															</p>

															<p>Susy felt that she was almost worthy of Kathleen's
																friendship as she regarded the silver forks.</p>

															<p>"You must never part with them, mother," she
																said—until Tom is married. Then, of course, they will
																belong to him."</p>

															<p>"You are a good little girl, Susy," said her
																mother. "Of course, there never was a boy like Tom. It
																was sweet of him to give up his egg to me last night."</p>

															<p>Having seen that the table was in perfect order,
																and that the dinner was cooking as well as dinner could
																in the oven, Mrs. Hopkins went upstairs to put on a lace
																collar and a neat black silk apron.</p>

															<p>Meanwhile Susy had locked herself into her own
																room. The crowning moment of her life had arrived. She
																had made up her mind that she would wear her new blouse
																at dinner that day. Susy's stockings were coarse, and
																showed darns here and there; Susy's shoes were rough,
																and could not altogether hide the disfiguring patches on
																the toes of each; Susy's skirt was dark-blue serge,
																fairly neat in its way. Altogether Susy from her waist
																down was a very ordinary little girl—the little daughter
																of poor people; but from her waist up she was
																resplendent.</p>

															<p>"Oh! if I could only show my sweet, sweet little
																badge," she thought, "it would make me perfect. But I
																daren't. The queen commands that it should be hidden,
																and the queen's commands must be obeyed."</p>

															<p>
																Susy slipped into her blouse. She fastened it; she put a
																belt round her waist. She curtsied before her little
																<!-- Page 148 -->
																<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a> glass. She bobbed
																here; she bobbed there. She looked at herself front
																view, then over her shoulder, then, with a morsel of
																glass, at her back; she surveyed herself, as far as the
																limited accommodation of her room afforded, from every
																point of view. Finally, with flushed cheeks and a very
																proud expression on her face, she tripped downstairs.
																The pale-blue cashmere blouse, with its real lace and
																embroidered trimmings, might have been worn by any girl,
																even in the highest station of life.
															</p>

															<p>Mrs. Hopkins was busy in the kitchen. She called
																to Susy:</p>

															<p>"Come and hold the vegetable dish, child. I hear
																Tom pushing Aunt Church in at the gate; I know he is
																doing it by the creak of the bath-chair. There never was
																a bath-chair that creaked like that. Hold this while
																I—Why, sakes alive, Susy! wherever did you get—"</p>

															<p>"Oh, it's my new blouse, mother."</p>

															<p>"Your new what?"</p>

															<p>"What you see, mother—my new blouse. Don't you
																admire it?"</p>

															<p>Mrs. Hopkins was so stunned that she could not
																speak for a moment. Her face, which had been quite
																florid, turned pale. She suddenly put up her hand and
																caught Susy by the arm.</p>

															<p>"Oh, mother, don't!" said the little girl. "Your
																hand isn't clean. Oh, you have made a stain! Oh, mother,
																how could you?"</p>

															<p>
																"Run upstairs at once, child, and take it off. For the
																life of you don't let <i>her</i> see it; she'd never
																forgive me. It isn't fit for you, Susy; it really isn't.
																Wherever did you get it from? Where did you buy it?"
															</p>

															<p>
																Now Susy had really no intention of making a secret with
																regard to the blouse. She meant to tell her mother
																frankly
																<!-- Page 149 -->
																<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a> that it was a
																present from Miss Kathleen O'Hara, but Mrs. Hopkins's
																manner and words put the little girl into a passion, and
																she was determined now not to say a word.
															</p>

															<p>"It is my secret," she said. "I won't tell you how
																I got it, nor who gave it to me. And I won't take it
																off."</p>

															<p>Just then there were voices, and Aunt Church
																called out:</p>

															<p>"Where are you, Mary Hopkins? Why don't you show
																yourself? Fussing over fine living, I suppose. Oh, there
																is your daughter. My word! Fine feathers make fine
																birds.—Come over and speak to me, my dear, and help me
																out of this chair. Now then, give me your hand. Be
																quick!"</p>

															<p>Susy put out her hand and helped Mrs. Church as
																well as she could out of the bath-chair. Tom winked when
																he saw the splendid apparition; then he stuck his tongue
																into his cheek, and coming close to his sister, he
																whispered:</p>

															<p>"Wherever did you get that toggery?"</p>

															<p>"That's nothing to you," said Susy.</p>

															<p>Mrs. Church glanced over her shoulder and looked
																solemnly at Susy.</p>

															<p>"It's my opinion," she said, speaking in a slow,
																emphatic, rather awful voice, "that you are a very, very
																bad little girl. You will come to no good. Mark my
																words. I prophesy a bad end for you, and trouble for
																your unfortunate mother. You will remember my words when
																the prophecy comes true. Help me now into the parlor. I
																cannot stay long, but I will have a morsel of your grand
																dinner before I leave."</p>

																<h3>AUNT CHURCH AT DINNER AND THE CONSEQUENCES
																	THEREOF.</h3>


																<p>When Mrs. Church was comfortably established in
																	the easy-chair in the little parlor, with her feet on
																	the fender, and a nice view of the street from the
																	window near by—when her best widow's-cap was perched
																	upon her head, and her little black mitts were drawn
																	over her delicate, small hands—she looked around her
																	and gave a brief sigh of satisfaction.</p>

																<p>"Upon my word," she said, "I'm not at all sorry I
																	came. There's nothing like seeing things for yourself.
																	Most elegant damask on the table. Mary Hopkins, where
																	did you get that damask?"</p>

																<p>Mrs. Hopkins, whose cheeks were flushed, and who
																	looked considerably worried, replied that it had been
																	left to her by her own mother.</p>

																<p>"My mother was a housekeeper in a nobleman's
																	family," she said, "and she was given that cloth and
																	two or three more like it. I have 'em in the
																	linen-chest upstairs, and I wouldn't part with 'em to
																	anybody."</p>

																<p>"I admire your pride," said Mrs. Church. "Next
																	door to pride comes honesty. I am sometimes inclined to
																	believe that it comes afore pride; but we needn't
																	dispute that delicate point at present. And the silver
																	forks. My word!—Tom, my boy, pass me a fork to
																	examine."</p>

																<p>Tom took up a fork and handed it to Mrs. Church.</p>

																<p>"Hall-marked and all!" she said.</p>

																<p>She laid it down with emphasis.</p>

																<p>
																	"Perhaps you know," she said, fixing her beady black
																	eyes upon Mrs. Hopkins's face, "that I'll be very low
																	as
																	<!-- Page 151 -->
																	<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a> regards victuals
																	for the rest of this week. But never mind; I am never
																	one to press what it ain't convenient to return. Ah!
																	and here comes the dinner. Well, I will say that I have
																	a good appetite.—You can push me right up to the table,
																	Tom, my boy."
																</p>

																<p>Tom did push the old lady into the most
																	comfortable seat. She now removed her mittens, put a
																	napkin on her lap, and bent forward with a look of
																	appetite to regard the different dishes which Ellen,
																	the tiny twelve-year-old servant, brought in. Ellen
																	trembled very much in the company of the old lady, and
																	Mrs. Hopkins trembled still more. But Susy, who saw no
																	reason why she should bow down before Aunt Church, ate
																	her good dinner with appetite, tossed her little head,
																	and felt that she was making a sensation. Tom was very
																	attentive to Mrs. Church, and helped her to a large
																	glass of ginger-wine. She thoroughly enjoyed her
																	dinner, and, while she was eating it, forgot all about
																	Susy and the pale-blue cashmere blouse.</p>

																<p>
																	But when the meat had been followed by the
																	apple-pudding, and the apple-pudding by some coffee
																	which was served in real china cups, and Mrs. Church
																	had folded her napkin and swept the crumbs from her
																	bombazine dress, and Mrs. Hopkins, assisted by Susy,
																	had removed the cloth, and the little maid had swept up
																	the hearth, Mrs. Church began to recollect herself. It
																	is true she was no longer hungry nor cold, for the fire
																	was plentiful, and the sun also poured in at the small
																	window. But Mrs. Church had a memory and, as she
																	believed, a grievance. In her tiny house on the common
																	four miles away firing was scarce, and food was
																	scarcer. The owner of the house did not care to spend
																	more than a very limited sum of money on coals and
																	food. There was nothing in the cottage for Mrs.
																	Church's supper except a bit of stale cake,
																	<!-- Page 152 -->
																	<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a> a hunch of brown
																	bread, and a little tea. The tea would have to be drunk
																	without milk, and with only a modicum of brown sugar,
																	for Mrs. Church was determined to spend no money, if
																	possible, until Mrs. Hopkins paid the debt which had
																	been due on the previous day. It was one thing,
																	therefore, for Mrs. Church's debtors to eat good roast
																	beef and good boiled pork and good apple-pudding, but
																	it was another thing for Mrs. Church to tolerate it.
																	She fixed her eyes now on Susy in a very meaning way.
																	Susy had never appealed to the old lady's fancy, and
																	she appealed less than ever to-day.
																</p>

																<p>"Come right over here, little girl," said Mrs.
																	Church, waving a thin arm and motioning Susy to
																	approach.</p>

																<p>Susy Hopkins, remembering her blouse and her
																	proud position as a member of the Cabinet of the Queen
																	of the Wild Irish Girls, felt for a moment inclined to
																	disobey; but Mrs. Church had a certain power about her,
																	and she impelled Susy to come forward.</p>

																<p>"Stand just in front of me," she said, "and let
																	me look at you. My word! I never did see a more elegant
																	figure. Don't you think that you are something like a
																	peacock—fine above and ugly below?"</p>

																<p>"No, I don't, Aunt Church," said Susy.</p>

																<p>"Tut, tut, child! Don't give me any of your
																	sauce, but just answer a straight question. Where did
																	you get that bodice? It is singularly fine for a little
																	girl like you. Where did you get it?"</p>

																<p>"I don't think it is any business of yours, Aunt
																	Church."</p>

																<p>"Susy!" said her mother in a voice of terror.
																	"Don't talk like that. You know very well you mustn't
																	be rude to Aunt Church.—Don't mind her, aunt; she is a
																	very naughty girl."</p>

																<p>
																	<!-- Page 153 -->
																	<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>"I am not,
																	mother," said Susy; "and it's awfully unkind of you to
																	say it of me. I am not a bit rude. But it is not Aunt
																	Church's affair. I didn't steal the blouse; I came by
																	it honestly, and it wasn't bought out of any of Aunt
																	Church's money."
																</p>

																<p>"That remains to be proved," said Mrs. Church.
																	"Susan Hopkins, I don't like you nor your ways. When I
																	was young I knew a little girl, and you remind me of
																	her. She had a face summat like yours, no way pretty,
																	but what you'd call boastful and conceited; and she
																	thought a sight of herself, and put on gay dress that
																	she had no call to wear. She strutted about among the
																	neighbors, and they said, 'Fine feathers make fine
																	birds,' and laughed at her past bearing. But she didn't
																	mind, because she was a little girl that was meant to
																	go to the bad—and she did. She learned to be a thief,
																	and she broke her mother's heart, and she was locked up
																	in prison. In prison she had to wear the ugly
																	convict-dress with the broad-arrow stamped on all her
																	clothes. Afterwards, when she came out again, her poor
																	mother had died, and her grandmother likewise; and her
																	brother, who was the moral image of Tom there, wouldn't
																	receive her in his house. I haven't heard of her for a
																	long time back, but most likely she died in the
																	work-house. Well, Susan, you may take my little story
																	for what it is worth, and much good may it do you."</p>

																<p>"I think you are very rude indeed, Aunt Church,"
																	said Susy. "I don't see that I'm bound to submit to
																	your ugly, cruel words. I like this blouse, and I'll
																	wear it whenever I wish."</p>

																<p>
																	"Oh, hoity-toity!" said the old lady; "impudent as well
																	as everything else. That I should live to see it!—Mary
																	Hopkins, can it be convenient to you to let me have the
																	remainder of my hundred pounds? There wasn't any con
																	<!-- Page 154 -->
																	<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>tract but that I
																	could demand it whenever I wanted it, and it is about
																	convenient to me that I should have it back now. You
																	owe me between thirty and forty pounds, and I'd like, I
																	will say, to see the color of my money. It can't be at
																	all ill-convenient to you to give it to me when you can
																	afford blouses of that quality for your impudent young
																	daughter. Real lace, forsooth! I know it when I see it.
																	We'll say Wednesday week to receive the money, and I
																	will come over in my bath-chair, drawn by Tom, to take
																	it; and I will give Tom a whole shilling for himself
																	the day I get it back. That will be quite convenient to
																	you, Mary Hopkins, won't it?"
																</p>

																<p>"Susy," said poor Mrs. Hopkins, "for goodness'
																	sake, leave the room.—Aunt Church, you know perfectly
																	well that I am not responsible for the naughty ways of
																	that naughty little girl. It's apologize to you she
																	shall, and that before you leave this house. And you
																	know that if you press me now to return the money in
																	full I'll have to sell up the shop, and the children
																	won't have anything to eat, and we'll all be ruined.
																	You wouldn't be as cruel as that to your own flesh and
																	blood, would you?"</p>

																<p>"Well, Mary, I only said it to frighten you. I
																	ain't at all a cruel woman. On the contrary, I am
																	kind-hearted; but I can't stand the sauce of that
																	little girl of yours. It's my opinion, Mary, that the
																	lost money of yours is on the back of your Susan, and
																	the sooner you get her to confess her sin the better it
																	will be for us all."</p>

																<p>Now, before Mrs. Hopkins had time to utter a word
																	with regard to this preposterous and appalling
																	suggestion of Aunt Church's, there came a loud knock on
																	the little street-door, and, listening in the parlor,
																	the people within could distinctly hear the rustle of
																	silk petticoats.</p>

																<p>"Who in the world can that be?" said Mrs.
																	Hopkins.</p>

																<p>
																	<!-- Page 155 -->
																	<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>Tom turned first
																	red and then white, and rushed into the passage. Susy,
																	who had been crying in the shop, also appeared on the
																	scene.
																</p>

																<p>"I'll open the door," said Tom. "Do wipe your
																	eyes, Susy; don't let her see you crying. It's herself,
																	of course."</p>

																<p>The knocker was just going to be applied to the
																	door again, when Tom opened it with a flourish, and
																	there stood, waiting on the steps, a very brilliant
																	apparition. This was no less a person than Miss
																	Kathleen O'Hara, in her Sunday best.</p>

																<p>Now, Kathleen tried to bear with Mrs. Tennant's
																	advice with regard to her clothes in the week, but on
																	Sundays she was absolutely determined that her love of
																	finery should find full vent. Accordingly, from her
																	store of rich and beautiful garments, she chose the
																	gayest and the most likely to attract attention. On the
																	present occasion she wore a crimson velvet toque. Her
																	jacket was bright blue, and she had a skirt to match.
																	On her neck she wore a rich necklet of flaming beads,
																	which was extremely becoming to her; and thrown
																	carelessly round her neck and shoulders was a boa of
																	white fur, and she had a muff to match. Altogether her
																	radiant dress and radiant face were quite sufficient to
																	dazzle Tom. But Susy pushed past Tom and held out her
																	hand.</p>

																<p>"Oh, Kathleen," she said, "I am glad you have
																	come. You'd best come into the shop with me; there's
																	company in the parlor, and I don't think you'd care
																	about it."</p>

																<p>Kathleen, of course, was just as pleased to stay
																	in the shop with Susy as to go into any other part of
																	the house; but just then Mrs. Hopkins put a sad,
																	distressed face outside the door, and Mrs. Church's
																	voice was heard in high and grating accents:</p>

																<p>
																	<!-- Page 156 -->
																	<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>"I want to see the
																	person who is talking in the passage."
																</p>

																<p>"Oh! don't go in," said Susy. "It's Aunt Church,
																	and she's dreadful."</p>

																<p>"An old lady?" cried Kathleen. "I love old
																	ladies."</p>

																<p>She pushed past Susy and made her appearance in
																	the parlor.</p>

																<p>Now, Mrs. Church was a person of discernment. She
																	strongly objected to gay dress on the person of little
																	Susy Hopkins; but, as she expressed it, she knew the
																	quality. Had she not lived all her earlier days as
																	housekeeper to a widowed nobleman? Could she ever
																	forget the fine folk she helped to prepare for in his
																	house? Now, Kathleen, standing in the tiny room, had a
																	certain look of wealth and distinction about her. Mrs.
																	Church seemed to sniff the fine quality air in a
																	moment; she even managed to rise from her chair and
																	drop a little curtsy.</p>

																<p>"If it weren't for the rheumatics," she said, "I
																	wouldn't make so bold as to sit before you, miss."</p>

																<p>"But why shouldn't you? I'm sorry you suffer from
																	rheumatism. May I bring a chair and come and sit near
																	you? Are you Mrs. Hopkins—Susy Hopkins's mother?"</p>

																<p>"Indeed, my dear, I'm truly thankful to say I am
																	not. And what may your name be, my sweet young lady?"</p>

																<p>"Kathleen O'Hara."</p>

																<p>"Oh, dear, but it's a mouthful."</p>

																<p>"I'm not English," said Kathleen; "I'm Irish. Do
																	you know, in our country we have old ladies something
																	like you. A good many of them have dresses like you;
																	and they live in little cottages, and we bring them up
																	to the castle and give them good food very, very often.
																	There are twelve of them, and they all live in their
																	tiny cottages close to each other. We make a great fuss
																	about them. They love to come to the castle for tea."</p>

																<p>
																	<!-- Page 157 -->
																	<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>"The castle!" said
																	Mrs. Church, more and more impressed. "I should think
																	they would like it. Who wouldn't like it? It's a very
																	great honor for an old lady to be entertained to her
																	tea in a castle. And so you live in a castle, my bonny
																	young lady?"
																</p>

																<p>"Yes; my father owns Carrigrohane Castle."</p>

																<p>"Eh, love! it is a mouthful of a word for me to
																	get round my lips. But never mind; it is but to look at
																	you to see how beautiful and good you are."</p>

																<p>"And you are beautiful, too," said Kathleen. "I
																	mean, you are beautiful for an old lady. I love the
																	beauty of the old. But I want to see Mrs. Hopkins, and
																	I want to see Susy. Susy is a great friend of mine."</p>

																<p>Mrs. Church opened her eyes very wide; her mouth
																	formed itself into a round O. An eager exclamation was
																	about to burst from her lips, but she restrained
																	herself.</p>

																<p>"And a very good little girl Susan Hopkins is,"
																	she said, after a moment's pause; "and a particularly
																	great friend of mine, being, so to speak, my
																	grand-niece.—Mary, my dear, call your little girl in."</p>

																<p>Mrs. Hopkins, in some trepidation, crossed the
																	room and called to Susy, who was still sulking in the
																	shop.</p>

																<p>"My visitor and all," she kept saying. "And I
																	wanted to have her all to myself; I had such a lot to
																	say to her. I never saw anybody quite so horrible as
																	Aunt Church is to-day."</p>

																<p>"Never mind, Susy; never mind," said her mother.
																	"The young lady is pleasing your aunt like anything,
																	and she has sent for you."</p>

																<p>"Come along in, Susan, this minute," called out
																	Mrs. Church. "Come, my pet, and let's have a little
																	talk."</p>

																<p>"Go, Susy, and be quick about it," said her
																	mother.</p>

																<p>
																	<!-- Page 158 -->
																	<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>By the aid of Tom
																	and Mrs. Hopkins, who pushed Susy from behind, she was
																	induced to re-enter the little parlor. There, indeed,
																	all things had changed. Kathleen called to her, made
																	room for her on the same chair, and held her hand. Mrs.
																	Church glanced from one to the other. Only too well did
																	she see the difference between them. One was a rather
																	plain little girl, the daughter of her own relation;
																	the other was a lady, beautiful, stately, and
																	magnificently dressed.
																</p>

																<p>"I know her kind," thought Aunt Church. "I have
																	aired beds for quality of that sort, and I have watched
																	them when they danced in the big ballroom, and watched
																	them, too, when their sweethearts came along, and
																	seen—oh, yes, many, many things have I seen, and many,
																	many things have I heard of those fair young ladies of
																	quality. She belongs to them, and she likes that
																	good-for-nothing, pert little Susy Hopkins! Yet it
																	don't matter to me. Susy shall have my good graces if
																	she has secured those of Miss Kathleen O'Hara."</p>

																<p>Accordingly, Mrs. Church changed her tactics. She
																	praised Susy in honeyed words to the visitor.</p>

																<p>"A good little girl, miss, and deserving of
																	anything that those who are better off can do for her.
																	She is a great help to her mother.—Mary Hopkins, come
																	nigh, dear. You are very fond of your Susy, aren't
																	you?"</p>

																<p>"Of course I am," said Mrs. Hopkins in an
																	affectionate voice.</p>

																<p>Susy longed to keep up her anger, but she could
																	not. She was soon smiling and flushing.</p>

																<p>"And what a neat little bodice my Susy is
																	wearing!" said Mrs. Church. "And bought with her own
																	hard-earned savings. You wouldn't think so, would you,
																	miss?"</p>

																<p>
																	<!-- Page 159 -->
																	<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>"It gives her
																	great credit," said Kathleen in a calm voice. "I like
																	people to wear smart clothes, don't you, Mrs. Church?
																	If you lived on our estate, I would dress you myself. I
																	love to see our old ladies gaily dressed. On Christmas
																	Day they come to the castle and have dinner as well as
																	tea. It is wonderful how smart they look."
																</p>

																<p>"They are very lucky ladies—very lucky," said
																	Mrs. Church. "They don't wear old bombazine like this,
																	do they?"</p>

																<p>"Your dress suits you very well, indeed," said
																	Kathleen; "but my old ladies wear velveteen dresses.
																	They save them, of course. We don't want them to be
																	extravagant; but they always come up to the castle in
																	velveteen dresses, with white caps, and white collars
																	round their necks; and they look very nice. They have a
																	happy time."</p>

																<p>"I am sure they have, miss."</p>

																<p>"Yes, they have a very happy time. They want for
																	nothing. There was an old lady belonging to our house
																	who left a certain sum of money, and the old ladies get
																	it between them. They get six shillings a week each,
																	and a dear little house to live in. We are obliged to
																	supply them with as much coal as they want, and
																	candles, and a new pair of blankets on the first of
																	every November, and a bale of unbleached calico on the
																	first of May. You can't think how comfortable they are.
																	And then, of course, we throw in a lot of extra
																	things—the black velveteen dresses, and other garments
																	of the same quality."</p>

																<p>"It must be a wonderful place to live in. Is it
																	very difficult to get into one of these houses, missy?"</p>

																<p>"I don't know. Would you like to come?"</p>

																<p>"That I would."</p>

																<p>"I'll write to father and ask him if you may."</p>

																<p>"Miss, it would be wonderful."</p>

																<p>
																	<!-- Page 160 -->
																	<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>"You'd be very
																	picturesque amongst them," said Kathleen, gazing at
																	Mrs. Church with a critical eye. "And you'd have so
																	much to tell them; because all the rest are Irish, and
																	they have never gone beyond their own country. But you
																	have seen such a lot of life, haven't you?"
																</p>

																<p>"Miss, I can't express all the tales I could
																	tell. I lived with the quality for so long. I lived
																	with Lord Henshel until he died; I was housekeeper
																	there. Oh, I could tell them lots of things."</p>

																<p>"It would be very nice if you came over; and I am
																	almost sure there is a cottage vacant," said Kathleen
																	in a contemplative voice. "It seems unfair to give the
																	cottages entirely to Irish people. We might have one
																	English old lady. You would enjoy it; you'd have such a
																	lovely view! And you might keep your own little pig if
																	you liked."</p>

																<p>Mrs. Church was not enamored with the idea of
																	keeping a pig.</p>

																<p>"Perhaps fowls would do as well," she said. "I
																	have a great fancy for birds, and I am fond of new-laid
																	eggs."</p>

																<p>"Fowls will do just as well," said Kathleen,
																	rising now carelessly from her seat. "Well, Mrs.
																	Church, I will write to father and let you know if
																	there is a vacancy; and you could come back with me in
																	the summer, couldn't you?"</p>

																<p>"Oh, miss, it would be heaven!"</p>

																<p>"Can't we go out and have a walk now, Susy?" said
																	Kathleen, who found the small parlor a little too close
																	for her taste.</p>

																<p>
																	Susy rushed upstairs, put on her outdoor jacket and a
																	cheap hat, and, trying to hide the holes in her gloves,
																	ran downstairs. Kathleen, however, was the last girl to
																	notice any want in her companion's wardrobe. She had
																	all her life been so abundantly supplied with clothes
																	that,
																	<!-- Page 161 -->
																	<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a> although she
																	loved to array herself in fine garments, the want of
																	them in others never attracted her attention.
																</p>

																<p>"Susy," she said the moment they got out of
																	doors, "what is the matter with Ruth Craven?"</p>

																<p>"With Ruth Craven?" said Susy, who was by no
																	means inclined to waste her time over such an
																	uninteresting person.</p>

																<p>"Yes. You must go to her house; you must insist
																	on seeing her, and you must find out and let me know
																	what is wrong. She has written me a most mysterious
																	letter; she has actually asked me to let her withdraw
																	from our society. Ruth, of all people!"</p>

																<p>"It is very queer of her," said Susy, "not to be
																	grateful and pleased, for she is no better than the
																	rest of us."</p>

																<p>"No better than the rest of you, Susy?" said
																	Kathleen, raising her brows in surprise. "But indeed
																	you are mistaken. The rest of you are not a patch on
																	her. She is my Prime Minister. I can't allow her to
																	resign."</p>

																<p>"Oh, well," said Susy, "if you think of her in
																	that way—"</p>

																<p>"Of course I think of her in that way, Susy. I
																	like you very much, and I want to be kind to everybody;
																	but to compare you or Mary Rand or Rosy Myers, or any
																	of the others, with Ruth Craven—"</p>

																<p>"But she is no better."</p>

																<p>
																	"She is a great deal better. She is refined and
																	beautiful. She mustn't go; I can't allow it. But she
																	has written me such a queer letter, and implored and
																	besought of me not to come to see her, that I am forced
																	to accede to her wishes. So you will have to go to her
																	to-night and tell her that she must meet me on my way
																	to school to-morrow. Tell her that I will go a bit of
																	the way towards her house; tell her that I will be at
																	the White Cross Corner at a
																	<!-- Page 162 -->
																	<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a> quarter to nine.
																	You needn't say more. Oh, Susy, it would break my heart
																	if Ruth did not continue to be a member of our
																	society."
																</p>

																<p>"I will do what you want, of course," said Susy.
																	"I'd do anything in the world for you, Kathleen. It was
																	so kind of you to come to see us this afternoon. You
																	will keep your promise and come and have tea with us,
																	won't you?"</p>

																<p>"I am very sorry, but I am afraid I can't. I do
																	wish I had a home of my own, and then I'd ask you to
																	have tea with me. But, Susy, how funnily you were
																	dressed to-day, now that I come to think of it! You did
																	look odd. That blouse is too smart for the coarse blue
																	serge skirt you were wearing."</p>

																<p>"I know it is; but I can't afford a better skirt.
																	Mother is rather worried about money just now. I know I
																	oughtn't to tell you, but she is. And, do you know,
																	before you came in Aunt Church was so horrid. She got
																	quite dreadful about the blouse, and she tried to make
																	out that I had stolen the money from mother to buy it.
																	Wasn't it awful of her? I can tell you it was a
																	blessing when you came in. You changed her altogether.
																	What did you do to her?"</p>

																<p>"Well," said Kathleen, "I rather like old ladies,
																	and she struck me as something picturesque."</p>

																<p>"She's a horrid old thing, and not a bit
																	picturesque. I hate her like poison."</p>

																<p>"That is very wrong of you, Susy. Some day you
																	will get old yourself, and you won't like people to
																	hate you."</p>

																<p>"Well, that's a long way off; I needn't worry
																	about it yet," cried Susy. "I do hate her very much
																	indeed. And then, you know, when you appeared she began
																	to butter me up like anything. I hated that the worst
																	of all."</p>

																<p>
																	<!-- Page 163 -->
																	<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>"I am sorry she is
																	that sort of old lady," said Kathleen after a pause;
																	"but I have promised to try and get her into one of our
																	almshouses. It would be rare fun to have her there."
																</p>

																<p>"But she is not a bit poor. She oughtn't to go
																	into an almshouse if she is rich," said Susy.</p>

																<p>"Of course she mustn't go into an almshouse if
																	she is rich; but she doesn't look rich."</p>

																<p>"She is quite rich. I think she has saved three
																	hundred pounds. You must call that rich."</p>

																<p>"I'm afraid I don't," said Kathleen.</p>

																<p>Susy was silent for a moment.</p>

																<p>
																	"There are so many different views about riches," she
																	said at last. "I am glad you are so tremendously rich
																	that you think nothing of three hundred pounds. Mother
																	and I often sigh and pine even for <i>one</i> pound.
																	For instance, now—But I mustn't tell you; it would not
																	be right. Perhaps Aunt Church will be a little nicer to
																	me now that you have taken her up. I'll threaten to
																	complain to you if she doesn't behave."
																</p>

																<p>Here Susy laughed merrily.</p>

																<p>"That's all right, Susan," said Kathleen. "I must
																	go back now, for I have promised to go for a walk with
																	Mrs. Tennant. No one ever thinks about her as she ought
																	to be thought of; so I have some plans in my head for
																	her, too. Oh, my head is full of plans, and I do
																	wish—yes, I do, Susy—that I could make a lot of people
																	happy."</p>

																<p>"You are a splendid girl," said Susy. "I wish
																	there were others like you in the world."</p>

																<p>
																	"No, I am not splendid," said Kathleen, her lovely dark
																	eyes looking wistful. "I have heaps and lashons of
																	faults; but I do like to make people happy. I always
																	did since I was a little child. The person I am most
																	anxious about at
																	<!-- Page 164 -->
																	<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a> present is Ruth:
																	I love Ruth so very much. You will be sure to see her
																	this evening, won't you?"
																</p>

																<p>"Sure and certain," said Susy. "I am very much
																	obliged to you, Kathleen; you have made a great
																	difference in my life."</p>

																<p>The two girls parted just by the turnstile.
																	Kathleen passed through on her way across the common to
																	Mrs. Tennant's house, and Susy went slowly back to the
																	High Street and the little stationer's shop.</p>

																<p>She found Mrs. Church in the act of being
																	deposited in her bath-chair, and Tom, looking proud and
																	flushed, attending on her. Mrs. Hopkins was also
																	standing just outside the shop, putting a wrap round
																	the old lady and tucking her up. When Susy appeared her
																	mother called out to her:</p>

																<p>"Come along, you ungrateful girl. Here's Aunt
																	Church going, and wondering why you have deserted her
																	during the last hour."</p>

																<p>"That's just like you, Mary Hopkins," said old
																	Mrs. Church. "You scold when there's no occasion to,
																	and you withhold scolding when it's due. I don't blame
																	your daughter Susan for going out with that nice young
																	lady. I am only too pleased to think that any daughter
																	of yours should be taken notice of by a young lady of
																	the Miss Kathleen O'Hara type. She's a splendid girl;
																	and, to tell you the honest truth, none of you are fit
																	for her to touch you with a pair of tongs."</p>

																<p>"Dear, dear!" said Susy. "But she has touched me
																	pretty often. I don't think you ought to say nasty
																	things of that sort, Aunt Church, for if you do I may
																	be able to—"</p>

																<p>Aunt Church fixed her glittering black eyes on
																	Susan.</p>

																<p>"Come here, child," she said.</p>

																<p>Susy went up to her somewhat unwillingly.</p>

																<p>
																	<!-- Page 165 -->
																	<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>"My bark is worse
																	than my bite," said old Mrs. Church. "Now look here; if
																	you bring that charming young lady to see me, and give
																	me notice a day or so before—Tom can run over and tell
																	me—if you and Tom and Miss Kathleen O'Hara would come
																	and have tea at my place, why, it's the freshest of the
																	plumcakes we'd have, not the stalest. And the
																	microscope should be out handy and in order, and with
																	some prepared plates that my poor husband used, which I
																	have never shown to anybody from the time of his death.
																	I have a magnifying-glass, too, that I can put into the
																	microscope; it will make you see the root of a hair on
																	your head. And I will—Whisper, Susy!"
																</p>

																<p>Susy somewhat unwillingly bent forward.</p>

																<p>"I will give you five shillings. You'd like to
																	trim your hat to match that handsome blouse, wouldn't
																	you?"</p>

																<p>Susy's eyes could not help dancing.</p>

																<p>"Five shillings all to yourself; and I won't
																	press your mother about the installment which was due
																	to me yesterday. I'll manage without it somehow. But I
																	want to see that beautiful young lady in my cottage,
																	and you will get the money when you bring her. That's
																	all. You are a queer little girl, and not altogether to
																	my taste, but you are no fool."</p>

																<p>Susy stood silent. She put her hand on the
																	moth-eaten cushion of the old bath-chair, bent forward,
																	and looked into Mrs. Church's face.</p>

																<p>"Will you take back the words you said?"</p>

																<p>"Will I take back what?"</p>

																<p>"If not the words, at least the thought? Will you
																	say that you know that I got this blouse honestly?"</p>

																<p>
																	"Oh, yes, child! I'd quite forgotten all about it. Now
																	just see that you do what I want; and the sooner the
																	better, you understand. And, oh, Susy, mum's the word
																	with
																	<!-- Page 166 -->
																	<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a> regard to me
																	being well off. I ain't, I can tell you; I am quite a
																	poor body. But I could do a kindness to you and your
																	mother if—if certain things were to come to pass. Now
																	that's about all.—Pull away, Tom, my boy. I have a rosy
																	apple which shall find its way into your pocket if you
																	take me home in double-quick time."
																</p>

																<p>Tom pulled with a will; the little bath-chair
																	creaked and groaned, and Mrs. Church nodded her wise
																	old head and she was carried over the country roads.</p>

																<p>Meanwhile Susy entered the house with her mother.</p>

																<p>"What a blessing," said Mrs. Hopkins, "that that
																	pretty young lady happened to call! I never saw such a
																	change in any one as what took place in your aunt after
																	she had seen her."</p>

																<p>"Well, mother, you know what it is all about,"
																	said Susy. "Aunt Church wants to get into one of those
																	almshouses."</p>

																<p>"Just like her—stingy old thing!" said Mrs.
																	Hopkins.</p>

																<p>"I don't want her to get in, I can tell you,
																	mother; and when Kathleen and I were out I told
																	Kathleen that she was a great deal too rich. She asked
																	me what her means were, and I said I believed she has
																	three hundred pounds put by. Now, mother, don't you
																	call that riches?"</p>

																<p>"Three hundred pounds!" said Mrs. Hopkins. "That
																	depends, child. To some it is wealth; to others it is a
																	decent competence; to others, again, it is poverty."</p>

																<p>"Kathleen didn't think much of it, mother."</p>

																<p>
																	"Well," said Mrs. Hopkins, "I have notions in my head.
																	Maybe this very thing can be turned to good for us;
																	there's no saying. I think if your aunt was sure and
																	certain to get into one of those almshouses she might
																	do a good turn to you, Susy; and she's sure and certain
																	to help Tom a little. But there! we can't look into the
																	future. I am
																	<!-- Page 167 -->
																	<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a> tired out with
																	one thing and another. Susan, my dear child, where did
																	you get that beautiful pale-blue blouse?"
																</p>

																<p>"I didn't get it through theft, mother, if that's
																	what you are thinking of. I got it honestly, and I am
																	not obliged to tell; and what's more, I won't tell."</p>

																<p>Mrs. Hopkins sighed.</p>

																<p>"Dear, dear!" she said, and she sat down in the
																	easy-chair which Mrs. Church had occupied and stared
																	into the fire.</p>

																<p>"I am not nearly as low-spirited as I was," she
																	said after a pause. "If Miss Kathleen will do something
																	for Aunt Church, it stands to reason that Aunt Church
																	won't be hard on us."</p>

																<p>Susy made no answer to this. She stood quiet for
																	a minute or two, and then she went slowly upstairs. She
																	removed the beautiful blouse and put on a common one.
																	She then wrapped herself in an old waterproof cloak—for
																	the sunshiny morning had developed into an evening of
																	thick clouds and threatening rain—and went downstairs.</p>

																<p>"Where in the world are you going?" said her
																	mother in a fretful tone. "I did think you'd sit
																	quietly with me and learn your collect. If you are
																	going out, it ought to be to church. I don't see what
																	call you have to be going anywhere else on Sunday
																	evening."</p>

																<p>"I want to see Ruth Craven. Don't keep me,
																	please; it is very important."</p>

																<p>"But I don't know who Ruth Craven is."</p>

																<p>"Oh, mother, I thought every one knew her. She is
																	the very, very pretty little granddaughter of old Mr.
																	Craven, who lives in that cottage close to the
																	station."</p>

																<p>"A handsome old man, too," said Mrs. Hopkins,
																	"but I confess I don't know anything about him."</p>

																<p>
																	"Well, he and his old wife have got this one beautiful
																	<!-- Page 168 -->
																	<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a> grandchild, and
																	she has joined the foundationers at the Great Shirley
																	School. Miss Kathleen O'Hara has taken up with her as
																	well as with me and other foundation girls, and instead
																	of having a miserable, dull, down-trodden life, we are
																	extremely likely to have the best life of any girls in
																	the school. Anyhow, I have a message for Ruth and I
																	promised to deliver it."
																</p>

																<p>"All right, child; don't be longer away than you
																	can help."</p>

																<p>Susy left the house. The distance from her
																	mother's shop to the Cravens' cottage was a matter of
																	ten minutes' quick walking. She soon reached her
																	destination, walked up the little path which led to the
																	tiny cottage, and tapped with her fingers on the door.
																	The door was opened for her by old Mrs. Craven. Mrs.
																	Craven was in her Sunday best, and looked a very
																	beautiful and almost aristocratic old lady.</p>

																<p>"Do you want my grandchild?" she said, observing
																	Susy's size and dress.</p>

																<p>"Yes; is she within?" asked Susy.</p>

																<p>"No, dear; she has gone to church. Would you like
																	to wait in for her, or would you rather go and meet
																	her? She has gone to St. James the Less, the church
																	just around the corner; you know it?"</p>

																<p>"Yes, I know it," said Susy.</p>

																<p>"They'll be coming out now," said Mrs. Craven,
																	looking up at the eight-day clock which stood in the
																	passage. "If you go and stand by the principal
																	entrance, you are safe to see her."</p>

																<p>"Thank you," said Susy.</p>

																<p>"You are sure you wouldn't rather wait in the
																	house?"</p>

																<p>
																	"No, really. Mother expects me back. My name is
																	<!-- Page 169 -->
																	<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a> Susan Hopkins. My
																	mother keeps the stationer's shop in the High Street."
																</p>

																<p>"To be sure," said Mrs. Craven gently. "I know
																	the shop quite well."</p>

																<p>Susy said good-bye, and then stepped down the
																	little path. What a humble abode the prime favorite,
																	Ruth Craven, lived in! Susy's own home was a palace in
																	comparison. Ruth lived in a cottage which was little
																	better than a workman's cottage.</p>

																<p>"There can't be more than two bedrooms upstairs,"
																	thought Susy. "And I wonder if there is a sitting-room?
																	Certainly there can't be more than one. The old lady
																	looked very nice; but, of course, she is quite a common
																	person. I should love to be Prime Minister to Kathleen
																	O'Hara. And why should there be such a fuss made about
																	Ruth? I only wish the post was mine—shouldn't I do a
																	lot! Couldn't I help mother and Tom and all of us? And
																	there is that stupid little Ruth—oh, dear! oh, dear!
																	Well, I suppose I must give her the message."</p>

																<p>She hurried her steps as these last thoughts came
																	to her, and presently she stood outside the principal
																	entrance of the little church. St. James the Less was
																	by no means remarkable for beauty of architecture or
																	adornment of any sort; nevertheless the vicar was a man
																	of great eloquence and earnestness, and in the evenings
																	it was the custom for the little church to be packed.</p>

																<p>By-and-by the sermon came to an end, the
																	voluntary rolled forth from the organ, and the crowd of
																	worshippers poured out. Susy stretched out her hand and
																	clutched that of a slim girl who was following in the
																	train of people.</p>

																<p>"Ruth, it is me. I have something to say to you."</p>

																<p>
																	Ruth's face, until Susy touched her, had been looking
																	like a piece of heaven itself, so calm and serene were
																	the
																	<!-- Page 170 -->
																	<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a> eyes, and so
																	beautiful the expression which lingered round her lips.
																	Now she seemed to awaken and pull herself together. She
																	did not attempt to avoid Susy, but slipping out of the
																	crowd of people who were leaving the church, she found
																	herself by the girl's side.
																</p>

																<p>"Come just a little way home with me," said Susy.
																	"It won't take me long to say what I want to say."</p>

																<p>She linked her hand in her companion's as she
																	spoke. Yes, there was little doubt of it, Ruth was
																	lovable. One forgot her low birth, her low
																	surroundings, when one looked at her. Susy had heard of
																	those few people of rare character and rare natures who
																	are, as it is expressed, "Nature's ladies." There are
																	Nature's gentlemen as well, and Nature's ladies and
																	Nature's gentlemen are above mere external
																	circumstances; they are above the mere money's worth or
																	the mere accident of birth. Now, Ruth belonged to this
																	rare class, and Susy, without quite understanding it,
																	felt it. She forgot the humble little house, the lack
																	of rooms, and the workmanlike appearance of the whole
																	place. She said in a deferential tone:</p>

																<p>"I have come to you, from Kathleen O'Hara. You
																	have done something which has distressed her very much.
																	She wants you to meet her to-morrow at the White Cross
																	Corner on your way to school; she wants you to be there
																	at a quarter to nine. That is all, Ruth. You will be
																	sure to attend? I promised Kathleen most faithfully
																	that I would deliver her message. She is very unhappy
																	about something. I don't know what you have done to vex

																<p>"But I do," said Ruth. "And I can't help going on

																<p>"But what is it?" said Susy, whose curiosity was

																	would."</p>

																<p>
																	"I can't tell you, Susan; it has nothing to do with
																	you.
																	<!-- Page 171 -->
																	<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a> It is a matter

																	<h3>RUTH RESIGNS THE PREMIERSHIP.</h3>


																	<p>The next morning Kathleen O'Hara was downstairs
																		betimes. She ran into the kitchen and suggested to
																		Maria that she should help her to toast the bread.
																		Maria, who was somewhat lazy, and who had already
																		begun to appreciate Kathleen's extreme good-nature,
																		handed her the toasting-fork and pointed to a heap of
																		bread which lay cut and ready for toasting on the deal
																		table in the center of the kitchen.</p>

																	<p>"Dear me, Miss Kathleen!" she said; "if only
																		Miss Alice was as good-natured as you, why, the house
																		would go on wheels."</p>

																	<p>"I often helped the servants at home," said
																		Kathleen. "Why isn't Alice good-natured?"</p>

																	<p>"She's made contrairy, I expect, miss."</p>

																	<p>"Cut on the cross, I call it," said cook, who
																		came forward at this juncture and offered a chair to
																		Kathleen.</p>

																	<p>"Well, if that's the case I'm sorry for her,"
																		said Kathleen. "It must be very unpleasant to feel
																		sort of peppery-and-salty and cross-grained all the
																		time."</p>

																	<p>"It isn't what you ever feel, miss," said cook
																		with an admiring glance at the young lady.</p>

																	<p>Kathleen fixed her deep-blue roguish eyes on the
																		good woman's face.</p>

																	<p>
																		<!-- Page 172 -->
																		<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>"No," she said,
																		"I don't think I am cross-grained. By the way, cook,
																		wouldn't you like a black silk apron embroidered with
																		violets to wear when you have done all your dirty work
																		in the kitchen?"
																	</p>

																	<p>"Cooks don't wear black silk aprons embroidered
																		with violets," was the good woman's answer.</p>

																	<p>"But this cook might, if a nice Irish girl, who
																		has plenty of money, gave it to her. I have it in the
																		bottom of my trunk. I asked Aunt Katie O'Flynn to send
																		it to me for your mistress, but your mistress doesn't
																		care for it. I will give it to you, cook.—And, Maria,
																		I've got a little toque for you. It is sky-blue with
																		forget-me-nots. Have you a young man, Maria? Most
																		girls have, haven't they? Wouldn't you like to walk
																		out with him in a sky-blue toque trimmed with
																		forget-me-nots?"</p>

																	<p>"It puts me all in a flutter to think of it,
																		miss," said Maria. "I am sure a sweeter young lady
																		never came into this house."</p>

																	<p>Kathleen chatted on to the retainers, as she
																		called cook and Maria, until she had toasted enough
																		bread. She then went into the dining-room. Alice was
																		there, looking pale and headachy. The day was a very
																		cold one, and the fire was by no means bright.
																		Kathleen's intensely rosy cheeks—for the fire had
																		considerably scorched them—attracted Alice's
																		attention.</p>

																	<p>"I do wish you wouldn't do servant's work," she
																		said. "You annoy me terribly by the way you go on."</p>

																	<p>"Oh, don't be annoyed, darling," said Kathleen
																		softly. "Just regard me as a necessary evil. You see,
																		Alice, however cross you are, I'd have the others all
																		on my side. There's your mother and David and Ben and
																		the two servants. It isn't worth while, Alice. If they
																		all like me, why shouldn't you?"</p>

																	<p>
																		<!-- Page 173 -->
																		<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>Alice made no
																		reply. Kathleen stood still for a moment; then she
																		glanced at the clock. It was a quarter past eight. She
																		must be out of the house in a little over a quarter of
																		an hour if she was to meet Ruth Craven at the White
																		Cross Corner. She sat down to the table, helped
																		herself to a piece of toast, and spread some butter on
																		it.
																	</p>

																	<p>"A cup of tea, please, Alice," she said.—"Oh,
																		what letters are those? Any for me? David, if you give
																		me a letter I'll—I'll love you ever so much. Ah, two!
																		Dave, you are a treasure; you are a darling; you are
																		everything that is exquisite."</p>

																	<p>It was Alice's place to pour out the tea. She
																		poured some out now, very unwillingly, for Kathleen,
																		who drew the cup towards her, stirred it absently, and
																		began to read her letters. Presently she uttered a
																		little shriek.</p>

																	<p>"It is from Aunt Katie O'Flynn, and she is
																		crossing the Channel, the darling colleenoge. She is
																		coming to London, and she wants me to see her. Oh,
																		golloptious! What fun I shall have! Boys, aren't you
																		delighted? It was Aunt Katie O'Flynn who sent me that
																		wonderful trunk of clothes. Won't she give us a time
																		now? I declare I scarcely know whether I'm on my head
																		or my heels.—Alice, you'd best make yourself agreeable
																		and join in the fun, for I can assure you it's
																		theaters and concerts and teas and dinners and—oh!
																		shopping, and every conceivable thing that can delight
																		the heart of man or woman, boy or girl, that will be
																		our portion while Aunt Katie—the duck, the darling,
																		the treasure!—is in London. Let me see; what hotel is
																		she going to? Oh, the Métropole. Where is the
																		Métropole?"</p>

																	<p>
																		"In Northumberland Avenue. But, of course, we are not
																		going up to London," said Alice. "We are only
																		schoolgirls. We are at school and must mind our
																		lessons. I am
																		<!-- Page 174 -->
																		<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a> trying for my
																		scholarship, and I mean to get it. And I don't
																		suppose, even if your aunt is coming at a most
																		inopportune time, that she is going to upset
																		everything."
																	</p>

																	<p>"That remains to be proved," said Kathleen. "I
																		am not going to have Aunt Katie so close to me without
																		having my bit of fun. Oh, dear, dear! look at the
																		time. I must be off."</p>

																	<p>"Why are you going so early? It is only
																		half-past eight."</p>

																	<p>"I have business, darling—a friend to meet. Have
																		you any objection?"</p>

																	<p>Kathleen did not wait for Alice's answer. She
																		dashed upstairs, and on the first landing she met Mrs.
																		Tennant, who had been suffering from headache, and was
																		in consequence a little late for breakfast.</p>

																	<p>"Mrs. Tennant," shouted Kathleen, "I have the
																		top of the morning as far as news is concerned. It is
																		herself that is crossing the briny. She'll be in
																		London to-night. Oh, did you ever hear of anything
																		quite so scrumptious? But what's the matter, dear?"</p>

																	<p>"Kathleen, I wish you wouldn't wear that really
																		good dress going to school."</p>

																	<p>
																		"Is it my old lavender, and my old satin blouse?" said
																		Kathleen, looking down at herself with a momentary
																		glance. "Ah, then, my dear tired one, it isn't dresses
																		I'll be thinking of when Aunt Katie is in London.
																		She'll get me more than I can wear. She'll fig you all
																		out, every one of you, if you like—you and Alice and
																		David and Ben and cook and Maria. Maria is keeping
																		company, she tells me, and would like a few fine
																		clothes—naturally, the creature! Well, Mrs. Tennant,
																		it's herself that is crossing, as I said; even now she
																		is in the big steamer, coming nearer
																		<!-- Page 175 -->
																		<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a> and nearer to
																		England. Shan't we have fun when she arrives?"
																	</p>

																	<p>"You haven't told me who it is yet, dear."</p>

																	<p>"Oh, darling, you haven't been listening. It is
																		the dear woman who sent me the box full of new
																		clothes—Aunt Katie O'Flynn, at your service. But
																		there! I must be off. I'll think of it all day, and it
																		will make me so happy."</p>

																	<p>Kathleen dashed away to her own room, put on her
																		outdoor things, and a moment or two later was running
																		as fast as she could in the direction of the White
																		Cross Corner. There she saw a silent, grave-looking
																		girl, very quietly dressed, standing waiting for her.</p>

																	<p>"Here I am," said Kathleen; "and here you stand,
																		Ruth. And now, what have you got to say for yourself?"</p>

																	<p>"I am sorry," said Ruth. "I thought when you
																		sent Susy to me with your message that I might as well
																		come here this morning; but I haven't changed my
																		mind—not a bit of it."</p>

																	<p>Kathleen's eyes, always extraordinarily dark for
																		blue eyes, now grew almost black. A flash of real
																		anger shot through them.</p>

																	<p>"Don't you think it is rather mean," she said,
																		"to give me up when you promised to belong to me—to
																		give me up altogether and to go with those dreadful,
																		proud paying girls?"</p>

																	<p>
																		"It isn't that," said Ruth, "and you know it. It is
																		just this: I can't belong to two sides. Cassandra
																		Weldon offers me an advantage which I dare not throw
																		away. It is most essential to me to win the
																		sixty-pounds scholarship. If I win it I shall be
																		properly educated. When I leave school I'll be able to
																		take the position my dear father, had he lived, would
																		have wished for me. I shall be able to support granny
																		and grandfather. You see for yourself,
																		<!-- Page 176 -->
																		<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a> Kathleen, that I
																		can't refuse it. It isn't a question of choice; it is
																		a question of necessity. I love you. Kathleen—I will
																		always love you and be faithful to you—but I can't
																		give up the scholarship."
																	</p>

																	<p>"I don't want you to," said Kathleen; "but why
																		shouldn't you belong to me and yet take the
																		scholarship? I don't want you to be with me all the
																		time. You can go to that horrible, detestable girl
																		when it is necessary, and have your odious coach to
																		post you up. But I want you more than anybody else.
																		Don't you know how I love you? Can't you do both?
																		Think it over, Ruth."</p>

																	<p>"I have thought it over, and I can't do it. I
																		would if I could, but it isn't to be done. It wouldn't
																		be right to you, nor right to Cassandra."</p>

																	<p>"Well, I think you are very mean; I think I hate
																		you."</p>

																	<p>Kathleen turned aside. She was impulsive,
																		high-spirited, and defiant, but where her passions
																		were concerned her heart was very soft. She burst into
																		tears now and flung her arms around Ruth's neck.</p>

																	<p>
																		"I like a lot of people," she said—"I like Mrs.
																		Tennant, and even Susy, although she's not up to much,
																		and two or three other girls—but I only <i>love</i>
																		you. In the whole of England I only love you, and you
																		are going to give me up."
																	</p>

																	<p>"No; I will still be your friend."</p>

																	<p>"But you have refused to join my society; you
																		have refused to belong to the Wild Irish Girls."</p>

																	<p>"I can't help myself."</p>

																	<p>"But you promised."</p>

																	<p>"I know I did. I made a mistake. Kathleen, there
																		is no help for it. I shall love you even if I don't
																		belong to the society. Now there is nothing more to be
																		said."</p>

																	<p>
																		Ruth disentangled herself from Kathleen's embrace, and
																		<!-- Page 177 -->
																		<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a> putting wings to
																		her feet, ran in the direction of the school. Kathleen
																		stood just where she had left her; over her face was
																		passing a rapid and curious change.
																	</p>

																	<p>"Do I love her any longer?" she said to herself.
																		"Oh, I think—I think I love her still. But she has
																		slighted me. She will be sorry some day. Oh, dear! The
																		only girl in the whole of England that I love has
																		slighted me. She has thrown ridicule upon me. She said
																		that she would be my Prime Minister, and she has
																		resigned everything for that horrible Cassandra. She
																		will be sorry yet; I know she will."</p>

																		<h3>THE SCHOLARSHIP: TROUBLE IS BREWING.</h3>


																		<p>
																			Over some of the girls of the Great Shirley School
																			there passed that morning a curious wave of
																			excitement. Those girls who had joined Kathleen's
																			society were almost now more or less in a state of
																			tension. Once a week they were to meet in the quarry;
																			once a week, whatever the weather, in the dead of
																			night, they were to meet in this sequestered spot.
																			They knew well that if they were discovered they
																			would run a very great chance of being expelled from
																			the school; for although they were day scholars, yet
																			integrity of conduct was essential to their
																			maintaining their place in that great school which
																			gave them so liberal an education, in some cases
																			without any fees, in all other cases with very small
																			ones. One of the great ideas of the school was to
																			encourage brave actions, unselfish deeds, nobility of
																			mind. Those girls who possessed any talent or any
																			specially strong characteristic had
																			<!-- Page 178 -->
																			<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a> every chance
																			offered to them in the Great Shirley School; their
																			futures were more or less assured, for the governors
																			of the school had powers to give grants to the clever
																			girls, to award scholarships for which all might
																			compete, and to encourage industry, honesty, and
																			charitable ideas as far as possible.
																		</p>

																		<p>Kathleen, when she entered the school and
																			started her society, had not the slightest idea that,
																			while she was trying to help the foundationers, she
																			was really leading them into very grave mischief. But
																			several of the foundationers themselves knew this;
																			nevertheless the fun of the whole thing, the
																			particular fascination which Kathleen herself
																			exercised over her followers, kept them her
																			undeniable slaves, and not for the world would any of
																			them have left her now that they had sworn fealty to
																			her cause. So Kathleen had thought when she left the
																			house that morning; but as she entered the school she
																			knew that one girl, and that the girl whom she most
																			cared for, had decided to choose the thorny path
																			which led far from Kathleen and her company.</p>

																		<p>
																			"In addition to everything else, she is quite mean,"
																			thought the little girl, and during that morning's
																			lessons she occupied herself far more in flashing
																			angry glances in the direction of Ruth one minute,
																			and at Cassandra the next, than in attending to what
																			she was about. Kathleen had been given much by
																			Nature. Her father was a very rich man; she had been
																			brought up with great freedom, but also with certain
																			bold liberal ideas as regards the best in life and
																			conduct. She was a very beautiful girl, and she was
																			warm-hearted and amiable. As for her talents, she had
																			a certain charm which does more for a woman than any
																			amount of ordinary ability; and she had a passionate
																			and great love for music. Kathleen's
																			<!-- Page 179 -->
																			<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a> musical genius
																			was already spoken of with much approbation by the
																			rest of the school. The girls used to ask her to
																			improvise. Kathleen could improvise in almost any
																			style, in almost any fashion. She could make the
																			piano sob with her heart-rendering notes; and again
																			she could bring forth music clear and fairy-like.
																			Again she would lead the tender and solemn strains of
																			the march; and again she would dance over the keys so
																			lightly, so ravishingly, that the girls kept time
																			with their feet to her notes. The music mistress was
																			anxious that Kathleen should try for a musical
																			scholarship, and she had some ideas of doing so
																			herself. But to-day she felt cross, and even her
																			music was at fault.
																		</p>

																		<p>"I can't do it," she said, looking Miss Spicer
																			full in the face. "It means such drudgery, and I
																			don't believe I'd play a bit better if I did."</p>

																		<p>"That is certainly not the case, Kathleen,"
																			said Miss Spicer. "Knowledge must be of assistance.
																			You have great talent; if you add to that real
																			musical knowledge you can do almost anything."</p>

																		<p>"But I don't think I much care to. I can play
																			on the piano to imitate any birds that ever sung at
																			home, and father loves that. I can play all the
																			dead-marches to make mother cry, and I can play—oh,
																			such dance music for Aunt Katie O'Flynn! It doesn't
																			matter that I should know more, does it?"</p>

																		<p>"I can't agree with you. It would be a very
																			great pleasure to me if I saw you presented with a
																			musical scholarship."</p>

																		<p>"Would it?" said Kathleen, glancing at the thin
																			and careworn face of the music teacher.</p>

																		<p>
																			"You don't know what it would mean to me," answered
																			Miss Spicer. "It is seldom that one has the
																			<!-- Page 180 -->
																			<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a> pleasure of
																			teaching real talent, and I can't say how refreshing
																			it is to me to hear you play as you do. But I want
																			you to improve; I want you to be a credit to me."
																		</p>

																		<p>"I'd like to please you, of course," said
																			Kathleen. She spoke gently, and then she added: "But
																			there is only one piano at the Tennants', and that is
																			in the drawing-room, and Alice or the boys or Mrs.
																			Tennant are always there. I have not many
																			opportunities to practice."</p>

																		<p>"I live in the same terrace," said Miss Spicer
																			eagerly, "and my piano is hardly ever used. If you
																			only would come and make use of it. There is a fire
																			in my sitting-room, and you could come at any hour
																			whenever you have a fancy. Will you? It would be a
																			great pleasure to me."</p>

																		<p>"You are very kind. Yes, I will come."</p>

																		<p>Kathleen bent towards the music mistress and,
																			somewhat to that lady's astonishment, printed a kiss
																			on her forehead. The kiss went right down into Miss
																			Spicer's somewhat frozen heart.</p>

																		<p>Immediately after school that day Cassandra
																			held out her hand to Ruth. Ruth went up to her
																			gravely.</p>

																		<p>"Well, Ruth," she said, "have you decided? I
																			hope you have. You told me you would let me know
																			to-day."</p>

																		<p>"I have, Cassandra," said Ruth.</p>

																		<p>Kathleen, who was standing not far away,
																			suddenly darted forward and stood within a foot of
																			the two girls.</p>

																		<p>"Have you really decided, Ruth?" she said. Her
																			tone was imperious. Ruth felt her gentle heart beat
																			high. She turned and looked with dignity first at
																			Kathleen and then at Cassandra.</p>

																		<p>"I will join you, Cassandra," she
																			said.—"Kathleen, I told you this morning what my
																			decision was."</p>

																		<p>"And I hate you!" said Kathleen. She tossed her
																			head and walked away.</p>

																		<p>
																			<!-- Page 181 -->
																			<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>Cassandra waited
																			until she was out of hearing.
																		</p>

																		<p>"You look very pale, dear Ruth," she said.
																			"Come home with me, won't you?"</p>

																		<p>Ruth did not speak. Cassandra laid her hand on
																			her arm.</p>

																		<p>"Why, you are trembling," she said. "What has
																			that horrid girl done to you?"</p>

																		<p>"Nothing—nothing."</p>

																		<p>"But she has."</p>

																		<p>"Please, Cassie, she is not horrid."</p>

																		<p>"Oh, well, we won't discuss her. She is not my
																			sort. Won't you come and have lunch with me, and we
																			can arrange everything? You are going to take
																			advantage of mother's offer?"</p>

																		<p>"I can't help myself. It is much too good to be
																			refused. It means—I can't tell you what it means to
																			me, Cassie. If I can only get a scholarship I shall
																			be able to help grandfather. And yet—I must tell you
																			the truth—I was very nearly declining it."</p>

																		<p>"I don't think I should ever have spoken to you
																			again if you had."</p>

																		<p>"Even so, I was very nearly declining it; for
																			you know I could not have accepted your offer and
																			been friends with Kathleen O'Hara in the way she
																			wants me to be. Now I am very fond of Kathleen, and
																			if I could please myself I would retain her
																			friendship. But you know, grandfather has lost some
																			more money. He heard about it two nights ago, and
																			that made me make up my mind. Of course I love you,
																			Cassie. I have loved you ever since I came to the
																			school. You have been so very, very kind to me. But
																			had I the choice I would have stayed with Kathleen."</p>

																		<p>
																			"Well, it is all a mystery to me," said Cassandra. "I
																			<!-- Page 182 -->
																			<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a> don't like
																			Kathleen; I will frankly say so. I don't think she
																			has a good influence in the school. That sort of very
																			rich popular girl always makes mischief. It is far
																			better for the school not to have anybody like her in
																			its midst. She has the power of attracting people,
																			but she has also the power of making enemies. It is
																			my opinion she will get into very serious trouble
																			before she leaves Great Shirley School. I shall be
																			sorry for her, of course."
																		</p>

																		<p>"But what do you mean? What sort of trouble can
																			she get into?"</p>

																		<p>"There are whispers about her that I don't
																			quite understand. But if it were known that she does
																			lead other girls astray, she would be had up before
																			the governors, and then she would not find herself in
																			a very pleasant position."</p>

																		<p>Ruth did not say anything. Her face turned
																			white. Cassandra glanced at her, uttered a quick
																			sigh, and resumed:</p>

																		<p>"Whether you like it or not, I am glad you are
																			out of the whole thing. I should hate you to get into
																			trouble. You are so clever, and so different from the
																			others, that you are certain to succeed. And now let
																			us hurry home. I must tell you all about our scheme.
																			You must come to me every day; Miss Renshaw will be
																			with us each evening from six to seven. Oh! you don't
																			know how happy you are making me."</p>

																		<p>Ruth smiled and tried to look cheerful.</p>

																		<p>Mrs. Weldon came out to meet the two girls as
																			they entered the pretty little cottage. Her face was
																			smiling.</p>

																		<p>"Ah, Cassandra!" she said, "now you will be
																			happy."</p>

																		<p>"Yes; Ruth has accepted our offer."</p>

																		<p>"Indeed I have, Mrs. Weldon," said Ruth; "and I
																			scarcely know how to thank you."</p>

																		<p>
																			<!-- Page 183 -->
																			<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>"Come in, dear,
																			and have some dinner.—Cassandra, I have just heard
																			from Miss Renshaw, and she is coming this
																			afternoon.—You can either stay, Ruth, when dinner is
																			over, or come back again."
																		</p>

																		<p>"I will come back," said Ruth. "Granny is not
																			very well, and I ought not to have left her, even to
																			have dinner here; but I couldn't help myself."</p>

																		<p>Cassandra brought her friend into the house.
																			They had a pleasant meal together, and Ruth tried to
																			forget that she had absolutely quarrelled with
																			Kathleen, and that Kathleen's heart was half-broken
																			on her account.</p>

																		<p>But Kathleen herself was determined not to give
																			way to any real feelings of misery on account of
																			Ruth's desertion.</p>

																		<p>"I have no time to think about it," she said to
																			herself.</p>

																		<p>When she returned to the house she found a
																			telegram waiting for her. She tore it open. It was
																			from Aunt Katie O'Flynn:</p>

																		<p>"I have arrived. Come and have dinner with me
																			to-night at the Métropole, and bring any friend you
																			like."</p>

																		<p>"What a lark!" thought Kathleen. "And what a
																			chance for Ruth if only she had been different! Oh,
																			dear! I suppose I must ask Alice to come with me."</p>

																		<p>"Whom is your telegram from, dear?" asked Mrs.
																			Tennant, coming up to her at that moment.</p>

																		<p>Alice was standing in the dining-room devouring
																			a book of Greek history. She held it close to her
																			eyes, which were rather short-sighted.</p>

																		<p>"It's from Aunt Katie O'Flynn. She has come,
																			the darling!" said Kathleen. "She wants me to go to
																			London to dine with her to-night. Of course I'll
																			go.—- You will come with me, won't you, Alice? She
																			says I am to bring some one."</p>

																		<p>
																			<!-- Page 184 -->
																			<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>"No, I can't
																			come," said Alice; "and for that matter no more can
																			you. It takes quite thirty-five minutes to get to
																			Charing Cross, and then you have to get to the
																			Métropole. We girls are not allowed to go to London
																			by ourselves."
																		</p>

																		<p>"As if that mattered."</p>

																		<p>"It matters to me, if it does not to you.
																			Anyhow, here is a note for you. It is from Miss
																			Ravenscroft, our head-mistress. I rather fancy that
																			will decide matters."</p>

																		<p>Kathleen tore open the note which Alice had
																			handed to her. She read the following words:</p>

																		<div class="blockquot">
																			<p>
																				"<span class="smcap">Dear Miss O'Hara</span>,—I
																				should be glad if you would come round to see me at
																				six o'clock this evening. I have something of
																				importance to say to you."
																			</p>
																		</div>

																		<p>"What can she mean?" said Kathleen. "I scarcely
																			know Miss Ravenscroft. I just spoke to her the first
																			day I went to the school."</p>

																		<p>"She has asked me too. What can it be about?"
																			said Alice.</p>

																		<p>"Then you can take a message from me; I am not
																			going," said Kathleen.</p>

																		<p>"What?" cried Alice. "I don't think even you
																			will dare to defy the head-mistress. Why, my dear
																			Kathleen, you will never get over it. This is
																			madness.—Mother, do speak to her."</p>

																		<p>"What is it, dear?" said Mrs. Tennant, coming
																			forward.</p>

																		<p>Alice explained.</p>

																		<p>"And Kathleen says she won't go?"</p>

																		<p>
																			"Of course I won't go, dear Mrs. Tennant. On the
																			contrary, you and I will go together to see Aunt
																			Katie
																			<!-- Page 185 -->
																			<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a> O'Flynn. She is
																			my aunt, and I wouldn't slight her for all the world.
																			She'd never forgive me.—You can tell Miss
																			Ravenscroft, Alice, that my aunt has come to see me,
																			and that I have been obliged to go to town. You can
																			manage it quite easily."
																		</p>

																		<p>Kathleen did not wait for any further
																			discussion, but ran out of the room.</p>

																		<p>"I do wish, mother, you'd try and persuade
																			her," said Alice. "I am sure, whatever her father may
																			be, he can't want her to come to school here to get
																			into endless scrapes. There is some mystery afoot,
																			and Miss Ravenscroft has got wind of it. I know she
																			has, because I have heard it from one or two of the
																			girls."</p>

																		<p>"But what mystery? What can you mean?" said
																			Mrs. Tennant.</p>

																		<p>"I don't know myself," said Alice, "but it has
																			something to do with Kathleen and a curious influence
																			she has over the foundation girls. I know Kathleen
																			isn't popular with the mistresses."</p>

																		<p>"That puzzles me," said Mrs. Tennant, "for I
																			never met a more charming girl."</p>

																		<p>"I know you think so; but, you see, mere charm
																			of manner doesn't go down in a great school like
																			ours. Of course I am sorry for her, and I quite
																			understand that she doesn't want to disappoint her
																			aunt, but she ought to come with me; she ought,
																			mother. I haven't the slightest influence over her,
																			but you have. I don't think she would willingly do
																			anything to annoy you."</p>

																		<p>"Well, I will see what I can do. She is a
																			wayward child. I am sorry that Miss Ravenscroft
																			expects her to go to see her to-day, as she is so
																			devoted to her aunt and would enjoy seeing her."</p>

																		<p>
																			Mrs. Tennant left the room, and Alice went steadily
																			on
																			<!-- Page 186 -->
																			<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a> with her
																			preparations. She wondered why her mother did not
																			come back. Presently she looked at the clock. It
																			wanted a quarter to six.
																		</p>

																		<p>
																			"Dear me! I must go upstairs now and fetch Kathleen.
																			She will have to tidy herself, and I must try to
																			persuade her not to put on anything <i>outre</i>,"
																			thought Alice.
																		</p>

																		<p>She rushed upstairs. She opened the bedroom
																			door. The bedroom was empty.</p>

																		<p>"Where can she be?" thought Alice.</p>

																		<p>There were signs of Kathleen's late presence in
																			the shape of a tie flung on the bed, a hat tossed by
																			its side, an open drawer revealing brushes and combs,
																			laces and colored ties, and no end of gloves,
																			handkerchiefs, &amp;c.; but not the girl herself.</p>

																		<p>"She really is a great trial," thought Alice.
																			"I suppose she has gone with mother to town. I wonder
																			mother yields to her. Kathleen will get into a
																			serious scrape at the school, that's certain."</p>

																		<p>Alice went to her own part of the room, which
																			was full of order and method. She opened a drawer,
																			substituted a clean collar for the one she had been
																			wearing during the day, brushed out her satin-brown
																			hair neatly, put on her sailor-hat and a small black
																			coat, snatched up a pair of gloves, and ran
																			downstairs. On the way she met Mrs. Tennant.</p>

																		<p>"Oh, mother," cried the girl, "where is
																			Kathleen? I didn't find her in her room, and I
																			wondered what had become of her."</p>

																		<p>
																			"Where is she?" said Mrs. Tennant. "I thought she was
																			going with you. I had a long talk with her. She did
																			not say much, but she seemed quite gentle and not at
																			all cross. I kissed her and said that I would go with
																			<!-- Page 187 -->
																			<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a> her to London
																			to see her aunt to-morrow, or that she might ask Miss
																			O'Flynn here."
																		</p>

																		<p>"I am sorry you did that, mother."</p>

																		<p>"Well, darling, it seemed the only thing to do;
																			and the child took it very well. Isn't she going with
																			you? She said she wouldn't be at all long getting
																			ready."</p>

																		<p>"She is not in her room, mother. I can't
																			imagine what has happened to her."</p>

																		<p>Mrs. Tennant ran upstairs in some alarm.
																			Kathleen had certainly flown. The disordered state of
																			the room gave evidence of this; and then on a nearer
																			view Mrs. Tennant found a tiny piece of paper pinned
																			in conventional fashion to the pin-cushion. She took
																			it up and read:</p>

																		<p>"Gone to London to Aunt Katie O'Flynn."</p>

																		<p>"Well, she is a naughty girl. How troublesome!
																			I must follow her, of course," said Mrs. Tennant.
																			"Really this is provoking."</p>

																		<p>"Oh, mother, it isn't worth while fretting
																			about her. She is quite hopeless," said Alice. "But
																			there! I must make the best of it to Miss
																			Ravenscroft, only I am sure she will be very angry
																			with Kathleen."</p>

																		<p>Alice flew to the school. She was met by a
																			teacher, who asked her where she was going.</p>

																		<p>"To see Miss Ravenscroft," replied Alice. "I
																			had a note asking me to call at six o'clock. Do you
																			know anything about it, Miss Purcell?"</p>

																		<p>"Perhaps she wants to question you about Miss
																			O'Hara. There is some commotion in the school in
																			connection with her. She seems to be displeasing some
																			of those in authority."</p>

																		<p>"Kathleen had a note too, asking her to call."</p>

																		<p>
																			<!-- Page 188 -->
																			<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>"Then it must be
																			about her. But where is she? Isn't she going with
																			you?"
																		</p>

																		<p>Alice threw up her hands.</p>

																		<p>"Don't ask me," she said; "perhaps the less I
																			say the better. I am late as it is. I won't keep you
																			now, Miss Purcell."</p>

																		<p>Alice ran the rest of the way. She entered the
																			great school, and knocked at the front entrance. This
																			door was never opened except to the head-mistress and
																			her visitors. After a time an elderly servant
																			answered her summons.</p>

																		<p>"I am Alice Tennant," said the young girl, "and
																			I have come at Miss Ravenscroft's request to see
																			her."</p>

																		<p>"Oh yes, miss, certainly. She said she was
																			expecting two young ladies."</p>

																		<p>"Well, I am one of them. Can you let her know?"</p>

																		<p>"Step in here, miss."</p>

																		<p>Alice was shown into a small waiting-room. A
																			moment later the servant returned.</p>

																		<p>"Will you follow me, miss?" she said.</p>

																		<p>
																			They went down a passage and entered a brightly and
																			cheerfully furnished sitting-room. There was a fire
																			in the grate, and electric light made all things as
																			bright as day. A tall lady with jet-black hair combed
																			back from a massive forehead, and beautifully dressed
																			in long, clinging garments of deep purple, stood on
																			the hearth. Round her neck was a collar of old
																			Mechlin lace; she wore cuffs of the same with ruffles
																			at the wrist. Her hands were small and white. She had
																			one massive diamond ring on the third finger. This
																			lady was the great Miss Ravenscroft, the head of the
																			school, one of the most persuasive, most fascinating,
																			and most influential teachers in the whole realm of
																			girlhood. Her opinion was asked by
																			<!-- Page 189 -->
																			<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a> anxious mothers
																			and fathers and guardians. The girls whom she took
																			into her own house and helped with her own counsel
																			were thought the luckiest in England. Even Alice, who
																			was reckoned a good girl as good girls go, had never
																			before come in personal contact with Miss
																			Ravenscroft. The head-mistress superintended the
																			management of every girl in the school, but she did
																			not show herself except when she read prayers in her
																			deep musical voice morning after morning, or when
																			something very special occurred. Miss Ravenscroft did
																			not smile when Alice appeared, nor did she hold out
																			her hand. She bowed very slightly and then dropped
																			into a chair, and pointed to another for the girl to
																			take.
																		</p>

																		<p>"You are Alice Tennant?"</p>

																		<p>"Yes, madam."</p>

																		<p>"You are in the upper fifth?"</p>

																		<p>"Yes," said Alice again.</p>

																		<p>"I have had very good reports of you from Miss
																			Purcell and Miss Dove and others; you will probably
																			be in the sixth next year."</p>

																		<p>"I hope so; it will be a very great delight to
																			me."</p>

																		<p>Alice trembled and colored, looked down, and
																			then looked up again. Miss Ravenscroft was regarding
																			her with kindly eyes. Hers was a sort of veiled face;
																			she seldom gave way to her feelings. Part of her
																			power lay in her potential attitudes, in the
																			possibilities which she seldom, except on very rare
																			occasions, exhibited to their fullest extent. Alice
																			felt that she had only approached the extreme edge of
																			Miss Ravenscroft's nature. Miss Ravenscroft was
																			silent for a minute; then she said gently:</p>

																		<p>"And your friend, Kathleen O'Hara? I wrote to
																			her also. Why isn't she here?"</p>

																		<p>
																			<!-- Page 190 -->
																			<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>"I am very sorry
																			indeed," said Alice; "it isn't my fault."
																		</p>

																		<p>"We won't talk of faults, if you please, Alice
																			Tennant. I asked you why your friend isn't here."</p>

																		<p>"I must explain. She isn't my friend. She lives
																			with mother—I mean she boards with mother."</p>

																		<p>"Why isn't she here?"</p>

																		<p>"She got your letter. I suppose she didn't
																			understand; she is so new to schools. She is not
																			coming."</p>

																		<p>"Not coming? But I commanded."</p>

																		<p>"I know, I tried to explain, but she is new to
																			school and—and spoilt."</p>

																		<p>"She must be."</p>

																		<p>Miss Ravenscroft was silent for a minute.</p>

																		<p>"We will defer the subject of Kathleen O'Hara
																			until I have the pleasure of speaking to her," she
																			said then. "But now, as you are here, I should like
																			to ask you a few questions."</p>

																		<p>"Yes."</p>

																		<p>"What you say, Alice Tennant, will not be—I
																			speak in judicial phrase"—here Miss Ravenscroft gave
																			vent to a faint smile—"used against you. I should
																			like to have what information you can give me. There
																			is a disturbing element in this school. Do you know
																			anything about it?"</p>

																		<p>"Nothing absolutely."</p>

																		<p>"But you agree with me that there is a
																			disturbing element?"</p>

																		<p>"I am afraid I do."</p>

																		<p>"It has been traced to Kathleen O'Hara."</p>

																		<p>Alice was silent.</p>

																		<p>
																			"It is influencing a number of girls who can be very
																			easily impressed, and who form a very important part
																			of
																			<!-- Page 191 -->
																			<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a> this school.
																			Special arrangements were made more than a hundred
																			years ago by the founders of the school that they
																			should receive an education in every way calculated
																			to help them in life; the influence to which I allude
																			undermines these good things. It must therefore be
																			put a stop to, and the first way to put a stop to
																			anything of the sort is to discover all about it. It
																			is necessary that I should know all that is to be
																			known with regard to the unruly condition of the
																			foundationers of the Great Shirley School. The person
																			who can doubtless tell me most is Kathleen O'Hara.
																			The mere fact of her defying my authority and
																			refusing to come to see me when she is summoned,
																			shows that she is insubordinate as far as this school
																			is concerned."
																		</p>

																		<p>Alice sat very still.</p>

																		<p>"She has not chosen to appear, and I wish to
																			take quick and instant steps. Can you help me?"</p>

																		<p>"I could," said Alice—"that is, of course, I
																			live in the same house with her—but I would much
																			rather not."</p>

																		<p>
																			"You will in no way be blamed, but it is absolutely
																			essential that you should give me your assistance. I
																			am authorized to ask for it. I shall see Kathleen
																			O'Hara, but from what you say, and from what I have
																			heard, I am greatly shocked to have to say it, but I
																			think it possible that she may not be induced to tell
																			the exact truth. If, therefore, you notice
																			anything—if anything is brought to your ears which I
																			ought to know—you must come to me at once. Do not
																			suppose that I want you to be a spy in this matter,
																			but what is troubling the school must be discovered,
																			and within the next few days. Now you understand.
																			Remember that what I have said to you is said in the
																			interest of the school, and absolutely behind closed
																			doors. You are not to repeat it to anybody. You
																			<!-- Page 192 -->
																			<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a> can go now,
																			Alice Tennant. Personally I am pleased with you. I
																			like your manner; I hear good accounts of your
																			attention to lessons. In pleasing me you will please
																			the governors of the school, and doubtless be able to
																			help yourself and your mother, a most worthy lady, in
																			the long run."
																		</p>

																		<p>"I am very much obliged to you," said Alice.
																			"You have spoken kind words to me; but what you have
																			set me to do is not at all to my taste. It seems
																			scarcely fair, for I must say that I don't like
																			Kathleen. She and I have never got on. It seems
																			scarcely fair that I should be the one to run her to
																			earth."</p>

																		<p>"The fairness or the unfairness of the question
																			is not now to be discussed," said Miss Ravenscroft.</p>

																		<p>She rose as she spoke.</p>

																		<p>
																			"You are unfortunately in the position of her most
																			intimate friend," she continued, "for you and she
																			live in the same house. Regard what you have to do as
																			an unpleasant duty, and don't consider yourself in
																			any way responsible for being forced into the
																			position which one would not, as a rule, advocate.
																			The simplest plan is to get the girl herself to make
																			a full confession to me; but in any case, you
																			understand, <i>I must know</i>."

																			<h3>KATHLEEN TAKES RUTH TO TOWN.</h3>


																			<p>
																				When Kathleen ran upstairs her heart was bubbling
																				over with the first real fierce anger she had almost
																				ever felt in her life. She was a spirited, daring
																				girl, but she
																				<!-- Page 193 -->
																				<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a> also had a
																				sweet temper. Now her anger was roused. Her heart
																				beat fast; she clenched one of her hands.
																			</p>

																			<p>"Oh, if I had Alice here, wouldn't I give it
																				to her?" she said to herself. "If I had that
																				detestable Miss Ravenscroft here, wouldn't I give
																				her a piece of my mind? How dare she order me about?
																				Am I not Kathleen O'Hara of Carrigrohane? Is not my
																				father a sort of king in old Ireland? And what is
																				she? I'll prove to her that I defy her. I will go to
																				see Aunt Katie O'Flynn; nothing shall keep me back."</p>

																			<p>Carried away by the wild wave of passion which
																				consumed her, Kathleen dressed hastily for her
																				expedition. She was indifferent now as to what she
																				wore. She put on the first head-dress which came to
																				hand, buttoned a rough, shabby-looking jacket over
																				her velvet dress, snatched up her purse which lay in
																				a drawer, and without waiting for either gloves or
																				necktie, ran downstairs and out of the house.</p>

																			<p>"I will go. I haven't the slightest idea how I
																				am to get there, but I will go to Aunt Katie
																				O'Flynn. I shall be in the train and far enough away
																				before they have discovered that I have gone," was
																				her thought.</p>

																			<p>From Mrs. Tennant's house to the station was
																				the best part of a mile, but Kathleen was fleet of
																				foot and soon accomplished the distance. She was
																				just arriving at the station when she saw Ruth
																				Craven coming to meet her. Ruth had enjoyed her hour
																				with Miss Renshaw, and was altogether in high
																				spirits. Kathleen stopped for a minute.</p>

																			<p>"Oh, Ruth," she said, "will you come to town
																				with me? It would be so nice if you would. I am
																				going to meet Aunt Katie O'Flynn. It would not be a
																				bit wrong of you to come. Do come—do, Ruthie."</p>

																			<p>
																				<!-- Page 194 -->
																				<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>"But I can't in
																				this dress," said Ruth, who felt suddenly very much
																				tempted.
																			</p>

																			<p>"Of course you can. Why, Aunt Katie is such a
																				darling she'll take us out if we want things and buy
																				them on the spot. And what does dress matter? We'll
																				be back in no time. What time does your grandmother
																				expect you home?"</p>

																			<p>"Oh, I don't know. I told granny I did not
																				exactly know what time I should be back, but she
																				certainly wouldn't expect me to be out late."</p>

																			<p>"Never mind; you are doing me a kindness. I
																				must go to see Aunt Katie, and it isn't convenient
																				for the Tennants to go with me. If we go together it
																				won't be a bit remarkable. Do come, Ruthie. You hurt
																				my feelings awfully this morning; you needn't hurt
																				them again."</p>

																			<p>"Very well," said Ruth. "I don't know London
																				at all, and I should like to go with you."</p>

																			<p>The two girls now turned into the railway
																				station. Kathleen gave a puzzled glance around her
																				for a minute, then walked boldly up to a porter,
																				asked him to direct her to the proper place to book
																				for London. He showed her the right booking-office,
																				and she secured two first-class single tickets for
																				herself and Ruth. The girls were directed to the
																				right platform, and in process of time found
																				themselves in the train. It so happened that they
																				had a compartment to themselves. Kathleen had now
																				quite got over her burst of anger, and was in the
																				highest spirits.</p>

																			<p>"This is fun," she said. "It is so awfully
																				nice to have met you! Do you know that Miss
																				Ravenscroft—the Great Unknown, as we Wild Irish
																				Girls call her—had the cheek to send me a letter?"</p>

																			<p>Ruth looked attentive and grave.</p>

																			<p>
																				<!-- Page 195 -->
																				<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>"She wanted me
																				to go and see her at six o'clock. Well, it is
																				half-past six now, and she will have to whistle for
																				me. Ruth, darling, you don't know how pretty you
																				look; and even though you have deserted me, and
																				won't join my darling, beloved society, yet I shall
																				always love you."
																			</p>

																			<p>Here Kathleen seated herself near Ruth and
																				flung one arm around her waist.</p>

																			<p>
																				"But," said Ruth, disentangling herself from
																				Kathleen's embrace, "you don't mean that Miss
																				Ravenscroft—Miss <i>Ravenscroft</i>—wanted you to go
																				and see her and you didn't go?"
																			</p>

																			<p>"No, I didn't go. Why should I go? Miss
																				Ravenscroft has nothing whatever to do with me."</p>

																			<p>"Oh, Kathleen! she is your mistress—the
																				head-mistress of the Great Shirley School."</p>

																			<p>"Well, and what about that? Aunty—my darling,
																				my own dear, sweet aunt Katie O'Flynn—sent me a
																				telegram to meet her in town. She is at the Hôtel
																				Métropole. Ruth, do you know where it is?"</p>

																			<p>"I haven't the most remote idea."</p>

																			<p>"Oh, well, we'll get there somehow. Never mind
																				now; don't look so worried. I shall be sorry I asked
																				you to come with me if you look any graver."</p>

																			<p>"But you make me feel grave, Kathleen," said
																				Ruth. "Oh, Kathleen, I can't tell how you puzzle me.
																				Of course, I know that you are very pretty and
																				fascinating, and that lots and lots of girls love
																				you, and will always love you. You are a sort of
																				queen in the school. Perhaps you are not the
																				greatest queen, but still you are a queen, and you
																				could lead the whole school."</p>

																			<p>"That would be rather fun," said Kathleen.</p>

																			<p>
																				"But you'd have to change a good bit. You'd have to
																				<!-- Page 196 -->
																				<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a> be just as
																				fascinating, just as pretty, but different somehow—I
																				mean—"
																			</p>

																			<p>"Oh, do tell me what you mean, and be quick.
																				We'll be in London before long."</p>

																			<p>"You wouldn't disobey Miss Ravenscroft if you
																				were to be our real queen."</p>

																			<p>"Then I'll not be your queen, darling, for I
																				shall disobey Miss Ravenscroft when it comes to a
																				case of obliging her or dear, darling, precious
																				aunty."</p>

																			<p>Ruth said no more. In her heart of hearts she
																				was very much distressed. She was sorry for her own
																				sake that she had met Kathleen, and that she was
																				going with her to London; but on the other hand she
																				was glad that she was with the girl, who by herself
																				might have got into a serious scrape.</p>

																			<p>Finally the two found themselves standing,
																				very forlorn and slightly frightened, on one of the
																				big platforms at Charing Cross.</p>

																			<p>"Now what are we to do?" said Kathleen.</p>

																			<p>"We must ask the way, of course," was Ruth's
																				answer. "Here is a porter who looks kind."</p>

																			<p>She went up to the man.</p>

																			<p>"Have you any luggage in the van, miss?" was
																				the immediate inquiry.</p>

																			<p>"No," she answered.</p>

																			<p>Ruth was quietly although shabbily dressed;
																				but she had on gloves, a neat hat, and a neat
																				necktie. Kathleen had on a very shabby coat, a most
																				unsuitable cap of bright-blue velvet on her
																				clustering masses of curls, and no necktie and no
																				gloves.</p>

																			<p>"What could be the matter with the pretty
																				young lady?" thought the man.</p>

																			<p>Ruth spoke in her gentle tones.</p>

																			<p>
																				<!-- Page 197 -->
																				<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>"We want to go
																				to see a lady at the Hôtel Métropole," she said.
																				"Which is the Hôtel Métropole?"
																			</p>

																			<p>"Oh, miss, it is quite close. You have only to
																				go out of the station, take the second turning to
																				your left, walk down Northumberland Avenue, and
																				you'll be there."</p>

																			<p>"But where is Northumberland Avenue? We don't
																				know anything about London," interrupted Kathleen.</p>

																			<p>"If you will allow me to put you two ladies
																				into a cab, the cabman will take you to the Hôtel
																				Métropole. It's only a step away, but you'd better
																				drive if you don't know your London."</p>

																			<p>"We have never been in our London before,"
																				said Kathleen in a voice of intense pleasure.</p>

																			<p>They now tripped confidently along by the side
																				of the porter. He took them into the yard outside
																				the station, and called a four-wheeler.</p>

																			<p>"No, no; one of those two-wheeled things,"
																				said the little girl.</p>

																			<p>A hansom was summoned, and the children were
																				put in. The driver was directed to take them to the
																				Métropole, and they started off.</p>

																			<p>"Ah!" said Kathleen, looking with great
																				appreciation around her—"ah! the lights—aren't they
																				just lovely? And see—see that water. That must be
																				the Thames. Oh, Ruth, mayn't we stand up in the
																				hansom? We could see ever so much better standing."</p>

																			<p>"No; sit down," implored Ruth.</p>

																			<p>"Why? Surely you are not frightened. There
																				never was any sort of conveyance that would frighten
																				me. I wish I might drive that horse instead of the
																				stupid old Jehu on the box. Isn't London a perfect
																				place? Oh, this is lovely, isn't it, Ruth?"</p>

																			<p>
																				"Thank goodness I'm not always bothered by that
																				dread
																				<!-- Page 198 -->
																				<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>ful speaking
																				voice inside me that you seem to have got," said
																				Kathleen.
																			</p>

																			<p>Here the cab drew up with a jerk at the
																				Métropole.</p>

																			<p>"How much are we to pay you?" asked Kathleen.</p>

																			<p>The man was honest, and asked the customary
																				shilling. A porter was standing on the steps of the
																				hotel. He flung the doors wide, and the two entered.
																				Presently a man came up and asked Kathleen what she
																				wanted. The hour was just before dinner, and the
																				wide hall of the hotel was full. Both men and women
																				turned and stared at the children. Both were
																				extremely pretty, Kathleen almost startlingly so.
																				But what about the gloveless little hands and the
																				untidy neck and throat?</p>

																			<p>"Please," said Kathleen, "we have come to see
																				my aunt, Miss O'Flynn. She is here, isn't she?"</p>

																			<p>The man said he would inquire, and went to the
																				bureau.</p>

																			<p>"Yes," he said after a minute's pause. "Will
																				you come to the drawing-room, young ladies?"</p>

																			<p>He conducted the children down some wide
																				passages covered with thick Turkey carpets, opened
																				the folding doors of a great drawing-room, and left
																				them to themselves. There was a minute or two of
																				agonized terror on the part of Ruth, of suspense and
																				rapid heart-beating as far as Kathleen was
																				concerned, and then a deep, mellow, ringing voice
																				was heard, and Miss Katie O'Flynn entered the
																				apartment.</p>

																			<p>"Why, I never!" she cried. "The top of the
																				morning to you, my honey! God bless you, my darling!
																				Oh, it is joy to kiss your sweet face again!"</p>

																			<p>A little lady, all smiles and dimples, all
																				curls and necklaces and gay clothing, extended two
																				arms wide and clasped them round Kathleen's neck.</p>

																			<p>
																				"Ah, aunty!" said Kathleen, "this is good. And I
																				<!-- Page 199 -->
																				<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a> ran away to
																				see you. I did, darling; I did. I have got into the
																				most awful scrape; nobody knows what will happen.
																				See me—without gloves and without a necktie. And
																				this dear little girl, one of my chosen friends,
																				Ruth Craven, has come with me."
																			</p>

																			<p>"Ah, now, how sweet of her!" said Miss
																				O'Flynn, turning to Ruth.—"Kiss me, my darling. Why,
																				then, you are as welcome as though you were the core
																				of my heart for being so kind to my sweet
																				Kathleen.—Come to the light, Kathleen asthore, and
																				let me look at you. But it isn't as rosy you are as
																				you used to be. It's a bit pale and pulled down you
																				look. Do you like England, my dear? If you don't
																				like it all at all, it's home you will come with me
																				to the old castle and the old country. Now then,
																				children, sit by me and let's have a talk. We'll
																				have a good meal presently, and then I have a bit of
																				a thought in the back of my head which I think will
																				please you both. Sit here anyway for the present,
																				and let us collogue to our hearts' content."</p>

																			<p>Miss Katie O'Flynn and her two young charges,
																				as she told the girls she considered them, drew a
																				good deal of attention as they sat and talked
																				together. The little lady was not young, but was
																				certainly very fascinating. She had a vivacious,
																				merry smile, the keenest, most brilliant black eyes
																				in the world, and a certain grace and dignity about
																				her which seemed to contrast with her rapid
																				utterances and intensely genial manner.</p>

																			<p>
																				Dinner was announced, and the three went into the
																				great dining-room. Miss O'Flynn ordered a small
																				table, and they sat down together. Ruth felt
																				unhappy; she keenly desired to go home again. She
																				was more and more certain that she had done wrong to
																				listen to Kathleen's persuasions. But Kathleen was
																				enjoying herself to the
																				<!-- Page 200 -->
																				<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a> utmost. She
																				was an Irish girl again, sitting close to one of her
																				very own. She forgot the dull school and the
																				dreadfully dreary house where she now lived; she
																				absolutely forgot that such a person as Miss
																				Ravenscroft existed; she ceased almost to remember
																				the Society of the Wild Irish Girls. Was she not
																				Kathleen O'Hara, the only daughter of the House of
																				O'Hara, the heiress of her beloved father's old
																				castle? For some day she would be mistress of
																				Carrigrohane Castle; some day she would be a great
																				lady on her own account. Now Kathleen's ideas of
																				what a great lady should be were in themselves very
																				sensible and noble. A great lady should do her
																				utmost to make others happy. She should dispense <i>largesse</i>
																				in the true sense of the word. She should make as
																				many people as possible happy. Her retainers should
																				feel certain that they dwelt in her heart. She
																				should love the soil of her native land with a
																				passion which nothing could undermine or weaken. The
																				sons of the soil should be her brothers, her
																				kinsmen; the daughters of the soil should be her
																				sisters in the best sense of the word. But not only
																				should the great lady of Carrigrohane love her Irish
																				friends, but men and women, both youths and
																				children, but she should love others who needed her
																				help. There never was a more affectionate, more
																				generous-hearted girl than Kathleen; but of
																				self-control she had little or no knowledge, and
																				those who crossed her will had yet to find that
																				Kathleen would not obey, for she was fearless,
																				defiant, resolute—in short, a rebel born and bred.
																			</p>

																			<p>
																				Ruth sat silent, perplexed, and anxious in the midst
																				of the gay feast. Kathleen and Aunt Katie O'Flynn
																				laughed and almost shouted in their mirth.
																				Occasionally people turned to glance at the trio—the
																				grave, refined, extremely pretty, but shabbily
																				dressed girl; the radiant
																				<!-- Page 201 -->
																				<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a> child, and the
																				vivacious little lady who might be her mother but
																				who scarcely looked as if she was. It was a curious
																				party for such a room and for such surroundings.
																			</p>

																			<p>"I think—" said Ruth suddenly. "Forgive me,
																				Kathleen, but I think we ought to be looking out a
																				train to go back by."</p>

																			<p>"Indeed, and that you won't," said Miss
																				O'Flynn. "You are going to stay with me to-night.
																				Why, do you think I'd let this precious darling
																				child back again in the middle of the night? And you
																				must stay here too—what is your name? Oh, Ruth. I
																				can get you a room here, and you shall have a fire
																				and every comfort."</p>

																			<p>"I at least must go home," said Ruth. "My
																				grandfather and grandmother will be sitting up for
																				me."</p>

																			<p>"Oh, nonsense, child!" said Miss O'Flynn. "I
																				can send a commissionaire down to tell your
																				grandfather that I am keeping you for the night."</p>

																			<p>"Of course, Ruth," said Kathleen. "Don't be
																				silly; it is absurd for you to go on like that. And
																				for my part I should love to stay."</p>

																			<p>"I am sorry, Kathleen," said Ruth, "but I must
																				go home. Perhaps one of the porters can tell me when
																				there is a train to Merrifield. I must go back, for
																				grandfather would be terrified if I didn't go home.
																				You, of course, must please yourself."</p>

																			<p>"My dear child, leave it to me," said Miss
																				O'Flynn. "You can't possibly go back—neither you nor
																				my sweet pet Kathleen. Oh, I'll arrange it, dear;
																				don't you be frightened. You couldn't go so late by
																				yourself; it wouldn't be right."</p>

																			<p>
																				Miss O'Flynn, however, had not come in contact with
																				a character like Ruth's before. She could be as
																				obstinate
																				<!-- Page 202 -->
																				<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a> as a mule. It
																				was in that light Miss O'Flynn chose to consider her
																				conduct.
																			</p>

																			<p>"I must go," she said. "I can't by any
																				possibility stay."</p>

																			<p>"Do, Ruth, for my sake," pleaded Kathleen,
																				tears in her eyes.</p>

																			<p>"No, Kathleen, not even for your sake. And I
																				think," added Ruth, "that you ought to come with me.
																				It would be much better for you to see Miss
																				Ravenscroft in the morning and explain matters to
																				her."</p>

																			<p>"Nonsense!" said Kathleen, now speaking with
																				decided temper. "That is my affair. I like you very
																				much, Ruth, but you really need not interfere with
																				me."</p>

																			<p>"I should think not indeed," said Miss
																				O'Flynn. "I know nothing about you, Miss Craven, but
																				you don't understand what a person of consequence my
																				niece is considered in Ireland."</p>

																			<p>"That may be," replied Ruth; "but at school
																				Kathleen, sweet and dear as she is, has to obey the
																				rules just like any other girl.—Please, Kathleen, do
																				be persuaded and come back with me.—Indeed, Miss
																				O'Flynn, if you will only believe me, it is
																				considered a very grave offence to miss morning
																				school or to be late when nine o'clock strikes; and
																				Kathleen can't be at school in time unless she
																				returns home now."</p>

																			<p>"I'm not going, so there!" said Kathleen.</p>

																			<p>"Perhaps some one would tell me when the next
																				train for Merrifield leaves Charing Cross," was
																				Ruth's next remark.</p>

																			<p>Before any one could reply to her, however, a
																				servant entered and said something in a low tone to
																				Miss O'Flynn.</p>

																			<p>
																				"Well, now," she said, speaking with eagerness, her
																				face all smiles and dimples, "the way is made plain
																				for you
																				<!-- Page 203 -->
																				<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a> at least, Miss
																				Craven.—Who do you think has come, Kathleen? Why,
																				the lady who has charge of you."
																			</p>

																			<p>"Mrs. Tennant? Oh, the dear tired one!" cried
																				Kathleen. "She can never be cross, and I like her
																				very much.—Where is the lady?" she added, turning to
																				the waiter.</p>

																			<p>"She is in the hall, miss."</p>

																			<p>Kathleen flew out, and before Mrs. Tennant,
																				who was really feeling very angry, could prevent
																				her, had flung her arms round her neck.</p>

																			<p>"Thank goodness it is you!" said the young
																				girl. "Now don't be angry, for you don't know how to
																				manage it. If it was Alice, wouldn't she be in a
																				tantrum? But you are all right; you haven't an idea
																				of scolding me. I arrived here as safely as a girl
																				could. And what do you think? I brought pretty Ruth
																				Craven with me. She didn't much like it, but here
																				she is; and she's on tenter-hooks to get home, so
																				she can return with you, can't she?"</p>

																			<p>"You must come too, Kathleen. You annoyed me
																				very much indeed. You gave me a terrible fright. I
																				did not know what might have happened to you,
																				knowing how ignorant you are of London and its
																				ways."</p>

																			<p>"But I have got a head on my shoulders,"
																				laughed Kathleen. "And now that you have come we
																				must have a bit of fun. I want to introduce you to
																				aunty. It is Aunt Katie O'Flynn, you know, the lady
																				who sent me the beautiful, wonderful clothes."</p>

																			<p>But here Miss O'Flynn herself appeared on the
																				scene. Kathleen did the necessary introducing, and
																				the two ladies moved a little apart to talk
																				together. By-and-by Miss O'Flynn called the two
																				girls to her side.</p>

																			<p>
																				"Mrs. Tennant is not angry with you now, Kathleen.
																				On the contrary, she loves you very much; and she
																				will take Miss Ruth Craven back with her. I have
																				been try
																				<!-- Page 204 -->
																				<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>ing to induce
																				her to stay here herself, but she won't; and as Ruth
																				is anxious to return home, her escort has come very
																				opportunely. As to you, darling, nothing will induce
																				me to part with you until to-morrow morning."
																			</p>

																			<p>"But what will you do about school?" said
																				Ruth.</p>

																			<p>"That can be managed," said Miss O'Flynn. "It
																				isn't the first time that Kathleen and I have got up
																				with the sunrise. We'll get up to-morrow before it,
																				I'm thinking, and take a train, and be in time to
																				have a good breakfast at Mrs. Tennant's.—Then if
																				you, my dear lady, will put up with me until
																				lunch-time, I can see more of my Kathleen, and
																				propound some plans for your pleasure as well as
																				hers. If you must go, Mrs. Tennant, I am afraid you
																				must, for the next train leaves Charing Cross for
																				Merrifield at ten minutes past nine."</p>

																			<p>Mrs. Tennant looked grave, but it was
																				difficult to resist Miss O'Flynn, and the time was
																				passing. Accordingly she and Ruth left the Hôtel
																				Métropole, and the aunt and niece found themselves
																				alone.</p>

																				<h3>MISS KATIE O'FLYNN AND HER NIECE.</h3>


																				<p>"Now, Kathleen," said Miss O'Flynn, "you come
																					straight up to my bedroom, where there is a cosy
																					fire, and where we will be just as snug as Punch.
																					We'll draw two chairs up to the fire and have a
																					real collogue, that we will."</p>

																				<p>"Yes, that we will," said Kathleen. "I have a
																					lot of things to ask you, and a lot of things to
																					tell you."</p>

																				<p>"Come along then, dear child. My room is on
																					the second floor; we won't wait for the lift."</p>

																				<p>
																					<!-- Page 205 -->
																					<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>Kathleen took
																					Miss Katie O'Flynn's hand, and they ran merrily and
																					as lightly as two-year-olds up the stairs. People
																					turned to look at them as they sped upwards.
																				</p>

																				<p>"Why, the little old lady seems as young and
																					agile as the pretty niece," said one visitor to
																					another.</p>

																				<p>"Oh, they're both Irish; that accounts for
																					anything," was the answer. "The most extraordinary
																					and the most lively nation on the face of the
																					earth."</p>

																				<p>The two vivacious Irishwomen entered their
																					bedroom. Aunt Katie flung herself into a deep
																					arm-chair; Kathleen did likewise, and then they
																					talked to their heart's content. It is good to hear
																					two Irishwomen conversing together, for there is so
																					much action in the conversation—such lifting of
																					brows, such raising of hands, such emphasis in
																					tone, in voice, in manner. Imagery is so freely
																					employed; telling sentences, sharp satire,
																					wit—brilliant, overflowing, spontaneous—all come to
																					the fore. Laughter sometimes checks the eager flow
																					of words. Occasionally, too, if the conversation is
																					sorrowful, tears flow and sobs come from the
																					excited and over-sensitive hearts. No one need be
																					dull who has the privilege of listening to two
																					Irishwomen who have been parted for some time
																					talking their hearts out to each other. Kathleen
																					and her aunt were no exception to the universal
																					rule. Kathleen had never been from home before, and
																					Aunt Katie had things to tell her about every
																					person, man and woman, old and young, on the
																					Carrigrohane estate. But when all the news had been
																					told, when the exact number of dogs had been
																					recounted, the cats and kittens described, the
																					fowls, the goats, the donkeys, the horses, the cows
																					enumerated, it came to be Aunt Katie's turn to
																					listen.</p>

																				<p>
																					"Now my love, tell me, and be quick, about all you
																					have
																					<!-- Page 206 -->
																					<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a> been doing.
																					And first and foremost, how do you like school?"
																				</p>

																				<p>"Not at all, aunty; and I'm not learning
																					anything."</p>

																				<p>"My dear, that is sad hearing; and your poor
																					father pining his heart out for the want of you."</p>

																				<p>"I never wished to go to school," said
																					Kathleen.</p>

																				<p>"You will have to bear it now, my pet, unless
																					you have real cause for complaint. They're not
																					unkind to you, acushla, are they?"</p>

																				<p>"Oh, not really, Aunt Katie; but they're such
																					dull people. The teachers are dull. I don't mind
																					Miss Spicer so much; she's the music teacher. As to
																					Miss Ravenscroft, I have never even seen her."</p>

																				<p>"And who is she, darling?"</p>

																				<p>"The head-mistress, and no end of a toff."</p>

																				<p>"What's a toff, dear?"</p>

																				<p>"It's a slang word they use in stupid old
																					England."</p>

																				<p>"I don't admire it, my love. Don't you demean
																					yourself by bringing words of that sort home to
																					Carrigrohane."</p>

																				<p>"Not I. I shan't be a minute in the old place
																					before the salt breezes will blow England out of my
																					memory. Ah! it's I who pine to be home again."</p>

																				<p>"It will broaden your mind, Kathleen, and
																					improve you. And some of the English people are
																					very nice entirely," said Miss O'Flynn, making this
																					last statement in what she considered a widely
																					condescending manner. "So your are not learning
																					much?"</p>

																				<p>"I am getting on with my music. Perhaps I'll
																					settle down to work. I should not loathe it so much
																					if it was not for Alice."</p>

																				<p>"Ah! she's the daughter of Mrs. Tennant. I
																					rather took to Mrs. Tennant, the creature! She
																					seemed to have a kind-hearted sort of face."</p>

																				<p>
																					<!-- Page 207 -->
																					<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>"She's as
																					right as rain, aunty; and so are the two boys. But
																					Alice—she is—"
																				</p>

																				<p>"What, darling?"</p>

																				<p>"A prig, aunty. Detestable!"</p>

																				<p>"I never took to that sort," said Miss
																					O'Flynn. "Wouldn't you like some oyster-patties and
																					some plumcake to munch while you are talking,
																					deary?"</p>

																				<p>"I shouldn't mind."</p>

																				<p>"I'll ring and order them."</p>

																				<p>A servant appeared. Miss O'Flynn gave orders
																					which resulted in a rich and most unwholesome
																					supper being placed upon the table. Kathleen and
																					her aunt ate while they talked.</p>

																				<p>"And what occupies you, love, at all at all?"
																					said Miss O'Flynn as she ate her second
																					oyster-patty. "From your description it seems to be
																					a sort of death in life, that town of Merrifield."</p>

																				<p>"I have to make my own diversions, aunty, and
																					they are sprightly and entertaining enough. Don't
																					you remember when I told you to have all those
																					little hearts made for me?"</p>

																				<p>"To be sure, dear—the most extraordinary idea
																					I ever heard in my life. Only that I never cross
																					you, Kathleen, I'd have written to know the meaning
																					of it."</p>

																				<p>"It doesn't matter about you knowing."</p>

																				<p>Here Kathleen briefly and in graphic language
																					described the Society of the Wild Irish Girls.</p>

																				<p>"It is the one thing that keeps me alive,"
																					she said. "However, I'm guessing they are going to
																					make a fuss about it in the school."</p>

																				<p>"And what will you do then, core of my
																					heart?"</p>

																				<p>"Stick to them, of course, aunty. You don't
																					suppose I'd begin a thing and then drop it?"</p>

																				<p>
																					<!-- Page 208 -->
																					<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>"No; that
																					wouldn't be at all like you, you young rebel.".
																				</p>

																				<p>Kathleen laughed.</p>

																				<p>"I am all in a puzzle," she said, "to know
																					where to hold the next meeting, for there is no
																					doubt that some of the girls who hate us because
																					they weren't asked to join spied last time; so I
																					want the society to meet the night after next in a
																					new place."</p>

																				<p>"And I'll tell you what I've been thinking,"
																					said Aunt Katie; "that I'll be present, and bring a
																					sparkle of old Ireland to help the whole affair. So
																					you'll have to reckon with me on the occasion of
																					the next meeting."</p>

																				<p>Kathleen sat very still, her face thoughtful.</p>

																				<p>"Nothing will induce me to give them up," she
																					said, or to betray any girl of my society. Oh,
																					aunty, there's such a funny old woman! I met her
																					last Sunday. She's a certain Mrs. Church, and she
																					lives in a cottage about four miles from
																					Merrifield. We could have our meetings there—I know
																					we could—and she'd never tell. Nobody would guess.
																					She is the great-aunt of one of the members of the
																					society, Susy Hopkins, a nice little girl, a
																					tradesman's daughter."</p>

																				<p>"Oh, dear me, Kathleen! You don't mean to say
																					you demean yourself by associating with tradesmen's
																					daughters?"</p>

																				<p>"I do so, aunty; and I find them very much
																					nicer than the stuck-up girls who think no end of
																					themselves."</p>

																				<p>"Well, well," said Miss O'Flynn, "whatever
																					you are, you are a lady born and bred, and nothing
																					can lower that sort—nothing nor nobody. You must
																					make your own plans and let me know."</p>

																				<p>"I am sure I can manage the old lady, and I
																					will tell you why. She wants to join our
																					alms-women."</p>

																				<p>"What?"</p>

																				<p>
																					<!-- Page 209 -->
																					<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>"You know what
																					a snug time our dear old alms-women have. I was
																					telling Mrs. Church about it last Sunday. She took
																					a keen desire to belong to us, and I sort of half,
																					in a kind of a way, promised her. Is there likely
																					to be a vacancy soon, Aunt Katie?"
																				</p>

																				<p>"Well, dear, there is a vacancy at the
																					present moment. Mrs. Hagan breathed her last, poor
																					soul! and was waked not a fortnight ago. We'd
																					better wire to your father to keep the little
																					cottage vacant until we know more. This is going to
																					be interesting, and you may be quite sure that if
																					there is going to be a lark that I'm the one to
																					help you, my colleen bawn."</p>

																				<p>Kathleen and her aunt talked until late into
																					the night, and when the young girl laid her head on
																					her pillow she was lost immediately in profound
																					slumber.</p>

																				<p>It was not at all difficult for Kathleen to
																					wake early, and accompanied by Miss O'Flynn, she
																					arrived at Merrifield at half-past eight on the
																					following morning. She had no time, however, to
																					change her dress, but after washing her hands and
																					smoothing out her tangled hair, and leaving Miss
																					O'Flynn in the care of Mrs. Tennant—who, to tell
																					the truth, found her considerably in the
																					way—Kathleen, accompanied by Alice, started for
																					school.</p>

																				<p>"You'll catch it," said Alice.</p>

																				<p>"Oh, that's very likely, darling," said
																					Kathleen; "but I don't think I much care. Did you
																					see Miss Ravenscroft last night, and was she very,
																					very angry?"</p>

																				<p>
																					"I saw her, and she was more than angry—she was
																					astonished. I think you will have to put up with a
																					rather serious conversation with her this morning.
																					She asked me questions with regard to you and your
																					doings which, of course, I could not answer; but
																					you will have to answer them. I don't think
																					particularly well of you, Kathleen;
																					<!-- Page 210 -->
																					<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a> your ways are
																					not my ways, nor your ideas mine; but I don't
																					think, bad as you are, that you would tell a lie.
																					You will have to speak out the truth to Miss
																					Ravenscroft, Kathleen, and no mistake about it."
																				</p>

																				<p>"Thank you," replied Kathleen. "I think I can
																					manage my own affairs," she added, and then she was
																					silent, not exactly cross, but lost in thought.</p>

																				<p>The girls reached the school without any
																					further adventure. Prayers were held as usual in
																					the great hall, and then the members of the
																					different classes went to their places and the work
																					of the morning began. The work went on, and to look
																					at those girls, all steadfast and attentive and
																					studious-looking, it was difficult to realize that
																					in some of their hearts was wild rebellion and a
																					naughty and ever-increasing sense of mischief.
																					Certainly it was difficult to realize that one at
																					least of that number was determined to have her own
																					way at any cost; that another was extremely
																					anxious, resolved to tell the truth, and hoping
																					against hope that she would not be questioned.</p>

																				<p>School had very nearly come to an end when
																					the dread summons which both Ruth Craven and Alice
																					Tennant expected arrived for Kathleen. She was to
																					go to speak to Miss Ravenscroft in that lady's
																					parlor.</p>

																				<p>"Miss Ravenscroft is waiting," said the
																					mistress who brought Kathleen the message. "Will
																					you be quick, Kathleen, as she is rather in a
																					hurry?"</p>

																				<p>Kathleen got up with apparent alacrity. Her
																					face looked sunshiny and genial. As she passed Ruth
																					she put her hand on her shoulder and said in her
																					most pleasant voice:</p>

																				<p>"Extraordinary thing; Miss Ravenscroft has
																					sent for me. I wonder what for."</p>

																				<p>
																					Ruth colored and looked down. One or two of the
																					<!-- Page 211 -->
																					<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a> girls glanced
																					round at Kathleen in amazement. She did not say
																					anything further but left the room. When she got
																					into the passage she hummed a little air. The
																					teacher who had summoned her had gone on in front.
																					Kathleen followed her at a respectful distance, and
																					still humming "The wearing of the Green," she
																					knocked at Miss Ravenscroft's door.
																				</p>

																				<p>Miss Ravenscroft was standing by her window.
																					She turned when Kathleen appeared, and desired her
																					to sit down. Kathleen dropped into a chair. Miss
																					Ravenscroft did likewise. Then Miss Ravenscroft
																					spoke gently, for in spite of herself Kathleen's
																					attractive face, the wilful, daring, and yet
																					affectionate glance in the eyes, attracted her. She
																					had not yet had a full and perfect view of
																					Kathleen. She had seen, it is true, the pretty
																					little girl in a crowd of others; but now she saw
																					Kathleen by herself. The face was undoubtedly
																					sweet—sweet with a radiance which surprised and
																					partly fascinated Miss Ravenscroft.</p>

																				<p>"Your name?" she said.</p>

																				<p>"Kathleen O'Hara," replied Kathleen.</p>

																				<p>She rose to her feet and dropped a little
																					bobbing curtsy, then waited to be asked to sit down
																					again. Miss Ravenscroft did not invite her to
																					reseat herself. She spoke quietly, turning her eyes
																					away from the attractive little face and handsome
																					figure.</p>

																				<p>"I sent for you last night and you did not
																					obey my command. Why so?"</p>

																				<p>
																					"I did not mean to be rude," said Kathleen. "You
																					see, it was this way. My aunt from Ireland (Miss
																					O'Flynn is her name—Miss Katie O'Flynn) was staying
																					at the Métropole. I had a telegram from her
																					desiring me to go to her immediately in town. I got
																					your note after I had read the telegram. It seemed
																					to me that I ought
																					<!-- Page 212 -->
																					<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a> to go first
																					to my aunt. She is my mother's own sister, and such
																					a darling. You couldn't but love her if you saw
																					her. You might think me a little rude not to come
																					to you when you sent for me, but Aunt Katie would
																					have been hurt—terribly, fearfully hurt. She might
																					even have cried."
																				</p>

																				<p>Kathleen raised her brows as she said the
																					last word; her face expressed consternation and a
																					trifle of amazement. Miss Ravenscroft felt as
																					though smiles were very near.</p>

																				<p>"Even suppose your aunt had cried," she said,
																					"your duty was to me as your head-mistress."</p>

																				<p>"Please," said Kathleen, "I did not think it
																					was. I thought my duty was to my aunt."</p>

																				<p>Miss Ravenscroft was silent for a minute.</p>

																				<p>"My dear," she said then gently, "you are new
																					to the school. You have doubtless indulged in a
																					very free-and-easy and unconventional life in your
																					own country. I was once in Ireland, in the west,
																					and I liked the people and the land, and the ways
																					of the people and the looks of the land, and for
																					the sake of that visit I am not going to be hard on
																					a little Irish girl during her first sojourn in the
																					school. In future, Kathleen O'Hara, I must insist
																					on instant obedience. I will forgive you for your
																					disregard of my message last night, but if ever I
																					require you again I shall expect you to come to me
																					at once. For the present we will forget last
																					night."</p>

																				<p>"Thank you, madam. I am sure I should love
																					you very much if I knew you well."</p>

																				<p>
																					"That is not the question, my dear. I must insist
																					on your treating me with respect. It is not very
																					easy to know the head-mistress; the girls know her
																					up to a certain point, but personal friendship as
																					between one woman
																					<!-- Page 213 -->
																					<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a> and another
																					cannot quite exist between a little girl and her
																					head-mistress. Yes, my dear, I hope you will love
																					me, but in the sense of one who is set in authority
																					over you. That is my position, and I hope as long
																					as I live to do my duty. Now then, Kathleen, I will
																					speak to you about the other matter which obliged
																					me to send you a message last night."
																				</p>

																				<p>"Thank you, ma'am," said Kathleen. She looked
																					down, so that the fun in her eyes could not be
																					seen.</p>

																				<p>"I am sure from your face that you will not
																					tell me a lie."</p>

																				<p>"No," said Kathleen, "I won't tell you a
																					lie."</p>

																				<p>"I must, however, ask you one or two direct
																					questions. Is it true that you have encouraged
																					certain girls in this school—"</p>

																				<p>"Oh, I encourage all the girls, I know. Poor
																					things! I—"</p>

																				<p>"Don't interrupt me, Kathleen; I have more to
																					say. Is it true that you encourage certain girls in
																					this school"—here Miss Ravenscroft put up her hand
																					to check Kathleen's words—"to rebellion and
																					insubordination?"</p>

																				<p>"I don't know what insubordination is," said
																					Kathleen, shaking her head.</p>

																				<p>"Is it true," continued the head-mistress,
																					"that you have started a society which is called by
																					some ridiculous name such as The Wild Irish Girls,
																					and that you meet each week in a quarry a short
																					distance from town; that you have got rules and
																					badges; that you sing naughty songs, and altogether
																					misbehave yourselves? Is it true?"</p>

																				<p>Kathleen closed her lips firmly together.
																					Miss Ravenscroft looked full at her. Kathleen then
																					spoke slowly:</p>

																				<p>"How did you hear that we do what you say we
																					do?"</p>

																				<p>
																					"I do not intend to name my informant. The girls
																					<!-- Page 214 -->
																					<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a> who have
																					joined your society and are putting themselves
																					under your influence are the sort of girls who in a
																					school like this get most injured by such
																					proceedings. They have never been accustomed to
																					self-restraint; they have not been guided to
																					control themselves. Of all the girls in the school
																					whom you, Miss O'Hara, have tried to injure, you
																					have selected the foundationers, who have only been
																					to Board schools before they came here. They look
																					up to you as above them by birth; your very way,
																					your words, can influence them. Wrong from your
																					lips will appear right, and right will appear
																					wrong. You yourself are an ignorant and unlearned
																					child, and yet you attempt to guide others. This
																					society must be broken up immediately. I will
																					forgive you for the past if you promise me that you
																					will never hold another meeting, that as long as
																					you are at the school you will not encourage
																					another girl to join this society. You will have to
																					give me your word, and that before you leave this
																					room. I do not require you to betray your
																					companions; I do not even ask their names. I but
																					demand your promise, which I insist on. The Irish
																					Girls—or the Wild Irish Girls, whatever you like to
																					call them—must cease to exist."
																				</p>

																				<p>Miss Ravenscroft ceased speaking.</p>

																				<p>"Is that all?" said Kathleen.</p>

																				<p>"What do you mean? I want your promise."</p>

																				<p>"But I have nothing to say."</p>

																				<p>"You are not stupid, Kathleen O'Hara—I can
																					see that—and I should hope you were too much of a
																					lady to be impertinent. What do you mean to do?"</p>

																				<p>
																					"Indeed," said Kathleen, "I don't mean to be
																					impertinent, and I don't want to tell a lie. The
																					best way on the present occasion is to be silent. I
																					can't give myself or the other girls in the school
																					away. You ask me to make
																					<!-- Page 215 -->
																					<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a> you a
																					promise. I cannot make that promise. I am sorry.
																					Perhaps I had better leave the school."
																				</p>

																				<p>"No, Kathleen, you cannot leave it in the
																					ordinary way. You are connected with other girls
																					now; your influence must be publicly withdrawn. I
																					had hoped to spare you this, but if you defy me you
																					know the consequences."</p>

																				<p>"May I go now?" said Kathleen.</p>

																				<p>"You may—for the present. I must consult with
																					the other teachers. It may even be necessary to
																					call a meeting of the Board of Governors. Your
																					conduct requires stringent measures. But, my
																					child"—and here Miss Ravenscroft changed her voice
																					to one of gentleness and entreaty—"you will not be
																					so silly, so wicked, so perverse. Kathleen, it is
																					sometimes a hard thing to give up your own way, but
																					I think an Irish girl can be noble. You will be
																					very noble now if you cease to belong to the Irish
																					Girls' Society."</p>

																				<p>"'Wild Irish Girls' is the name," said
																					Kathleen.</p>

																				<p>"You must give it up. It was a mad and silly
																					scheme. You must have nothing more to do with it."</p>

																				<p>Kathleen slightly shook her head. Miss
																					Ravenscroft uttered a deep sigh.</p>

																				<p>"I am afraid I must go," said Kathleen. "I
																					think you have spoken to me very kindly; I should
																					like to have been able to oblige you."</p>

																				<p>"And you won't?"</p>

																				<p>Kathleen shook her head again. The next
																					moment she had left the room.</p>

																				<p>
																					The school was nearly over; but whether it had been
																					or not, Kathleen had not the slightest idea of
																					returning to her class-room. She stood for a moment
																					in one of the corridors to collect her thoughts;
																					then going to the room where the hats and jackets
																					hung on pegs, she took down her
																					<!-- Page 216 -->
																					<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a> own, put them
																					on, and left the school. She walked fast and
																					reached Mrs. Tennant's house at a quarter to one.
																					Both Mrs. Tennant and Miss O'Flynn were out. There
																					was a message for Kathleen to say that Miss O'Flynn
																					expected her to be ready to go to town with her
																					immediately after dinner. Kathleen smiled to
																					herself.
																				</p>

																				<p>"Dear Aunt Katie! She must get me out of this
																					scrape. But as to thinking of giving up girls whom
																					I meant to help, and will help, I wouldn't do it
																					for twenty Miss Ravenscrofts." She stood at the
																					door of the house; then a sudden idea struck her,
																					and as she saw the girls; filing out of the school,
																					she crossed the common and met Susy Hopkins, her
																					satchel of books flung across her shoulder.</p>

																				<p>"Ah, Susy, here I am. I want to speak to
																					you."</p>

																				<p>Susy ran up to her in excitement. It was
																					already whispered in the school that their secret
																					proceedings were becoming known. It had also been
																					whispered from one to another that Kathleen had
																					undergone a formidable interview with Miss
																					Ravenscroft that very morning.</p>

																				<p>"What is it, Kathleen?" said Susy. "Was she
																					very, very cross?"</p>

																				<p>"Who do you mean?" asked Kathleen, instantly
																					on the defensive.</p>

																				<p>"Miss Ravenscroft. You went to see her; every
																					one knows it. What did she say?"</p>

																				<p>"That is my affair. But, Susy, I want you to
																					do something. We must not go to the quarry
																					to-morrow evening. We want to have the meeting at
																					your aunt's. I want to go to Mrs. Church's. You
																					must run round this afternoon and make
																					arrangements. There'll be about thirty or forty of
																					us, and we must all be smuggled into the cottage."</p>

																				<p>
																					<!-- Page 217 -->
																					<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>"Oh, dear!"
																					said Susy. "But how are we to get there? It's four
																					miles away."
																				</p>

																				<p>"Well, I suppose those who are really
																					interested can walk four miles. I certainly can.
																					Susy, you had better not miss it to-morrow night,
																					for Aunt Katie O'Flynn is to be present, and
																					there's no saying what she will do. She will help
																					us if any one can. She is ever so kind, and so
																					interested. It will be the greatest meeting the
																					society has ever had; I wouldn't miss it myself for
																					the world."</p>

																				<p>"Oh, hurrah!" said Susy. "You certainly are a
																					splendid girl, Kathleen. And won't Aunt Church be
																					pleased?"</p>

																				<p>"Tell her that if she wants to get one of the
																					little almshouses she had better oblige us as far
																					as she can," said.</p>

																				<p>Kathleen. "Now I must rush back to dinner. I
																					am going to town afterwards."</p>

																				<p>Without waiting for Susy's reply, Kathleen
																					turned on her heel and returned home. Susy watched
																					her for a minute, then slowly and gravely went in
																					the direction of her mother's shop. Mrs. Hopkins
																					was getting in fresh stock that morning, and the
																					little shop looked brighter and fresher than it had
																					done for some time. It was a beautiful day in the
																					beginning of winter, with that feeling of summer in
																					the air which comes to cheer us now and then in
																					November. Susy marched through the shop, still
																					swinging her satchel.</p>

																				<p>"I wish you wouldn't do that, Susy," said her
																					mother. "And I wish, too, that you wouldn't always
																					be late home. Be quick now; there's pease-pudding
																					and pork for dinner. Tom is in a hurry to be off to
																					his football."</p>

																				<p>"Oh, bother!" said Susy.</p>

																				<p>
																					Mrs. Hopkins frowned. Susy, in her mother's
																					opinion, was not quite so nice and comforting as
																					she once had been. But it was not Mrs. Hopkins's
																					way to reproach her chil
																					<!-- Page 218 -->
																					<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>dren; she bore
																					her burden with regard to them as silently and
																					patiently as she could.
																				</p>

																				<p>Susy ran up to her room, tossed off her hat,
																					washed her hands, and came down. Soon the three
																					were seated at their frugal dinner.</p>

																				<p>"You seem to have got in a lot of fresh
																					goods, mother," said Tom.</p>

																				<p>"I have," said Mrs. Hopkins, with a groan;
																					"but I haven't paid for one of them. Parkins says
																					he will trust me for quite a month; but however I
																					am to pay your Aunt Church, and keep enough money
																					for the new goods, beats me. Sometimes I think that
																					my burden is greater than I can bear. I have often
																					had a feeling that I ought to give up the shop and
																					take service somewhere. I used to be noted as the
																					best of good housekeepers when I was young."</p>

																				<p>"Oh, no, mother, you mustn't do that," said
																					Susy. "What would Tom and I do?"</p>

																				<p>"If it wasn't for you and Tom I'd give notice
																					to-morrow," said the widow. "But there! we must
																					hope for the best, I suppose. God never forsakes
																					those who trust Him."</p>

																				<p>"Mother," said Susy suddenly, "I hope you
																					will be able to spare me this afternoon. I want to
																					go and see Aunt Church."</p>

																				<p>"Why should you do that, child? There's no
																					way for you to go except on your legs, and it's a
																					weary walk, and the days are getting short."</p>

																				<p>"All the same, I must go," said Susy. "I
																					suppose you couldn't shut up the shop and come with
																					me, could you, mother?"</p>

																				<p>"Shut up the shop!" said Mrs. Hopkins. "What
																					next will the child ask? Not a bit of it, Susan.
																					But what do you want to see your aunt for?"</p>

																				<p>
																					"It is a little private message in connection with
																					Miss
																					<!-- Page 219 -->
																					<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a> Kathleen
																					O'Hara. It means money, mother; of that I am
																					certain. It means that Aunt Church will forgive you
																					last month's installment of the debt, and perhaps
																					next month's, too. You had best let me go, mother.
																					I am not talking without knowledge, and I can't
																					tell you what I know."
																				</p>

																				<p>"I know something," said Tom, and he gave
																					utterance to a low whistle.</p>

																				<p>Susy turned and glanced at her brother in
																					some uneasiness.</p>

																				<p>"There are a deal of funny things whispered
																					about your school just now," he said. "I'm not
																					going to peach, of course; only you'd best look
																					out. They say if it got to the governors' ears
																					every foundationer in the place would be expelled.
																					It is something that ought not to be done."</p>

																				<p>"Don't mind him, mother. Do you think I'd do
																					anything to endanger my continuing at the school,
																					after all the trouble and care and anxiety you had
																					in getting me placed there?"</p>

																				<p>"Really, child," said Mrs. Hopkins, "I don't
																					know. The wilfullness of young folks in these days
																					is past enduring. But you had better clearly
																					understand, Susy, that if for any reason you are
																					dismissed from the school there is nothing whatever
																					for you but to take a place as a servant; and that
																					you wouldn't like."</p>

																				<p>"I should think not, indeed. Well, mother, to
																					avoid all these consequences I must go as fast as I
																					can to see Aunt Church."</p>

																					<h3>SUSY HOPKINS PERSUADES AUNT CHURCH.</h3>


																					<p>Mrs. Hopkins said nothing more. Susy saw
																						that she could have her own way, and as soon as
																						dinner was over, without even waiting to help her
																						mother to put the place in order, she started on
																						her walk. She felt pleased and self-important. The
																						day was a frosty one, and the sunset promised to
																						be glorious. The road to Mrs. Church's house was
																						flat and long and pleasant to walk on. Susy had no
																						particular eye for pretty views, or she might have
																						pleased herself with the wonderful tints of the
																						sky, and the autumnal shades which had not
																						altogether deserted the neighboring woods. Susy's
																						thoughts, however, were occupied with very
																						different matters.</p>

																					<p>"Mother is always grumbling," she said to
																						herself; "and for that matter, so is Tom. As if
																						I'd demean myself by taking a place! The idea of
																						my being a servant. Why, I know I shall do very
																						well in the future. I look high. I mean to be a
																						lady, as good as the best. Would Miss Kathleen
																						O'Hara take so much notice of me if I was not a
																						very nice, lady-like sort of a girl? I am sure no
																						one could look sweeter than I do in my pale-blue
																						blouse. Even Tom says so. He said I looked very
																						genteel, and that he'd like his great friend,
																						Walter Amber, to see me. I don't want to have
																						anything to do with Tom's friends. Poor Tom! if
																						mother can apprentice him to somebody, that is the
																						most that can be expected. But as for me, the very
																						lowest position I intend to take in life in the
																						future is that of a teacher. I shall probably be a
																						teacher in this very school, and get my couple of
																						hundred a year. A place indeed! Poor dear mother
																						doesn't know what she is talking about."</p>

																					<p>
																						<!-- Page 221 -->
																						<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>Occupied with
																						her own thoughts, the road did not turn out long
																						to Susy. She reached Mrs. Church's very humble
																						abode between three and four o'clock. It was still
																						daylight. The little old lady was seated in her
																						window; she looked very much, surprised when she
																						saw Susy, and limped to the door and opened it.
																					</p>

																					<p>"Come in, Susy Hopkins," she said. "I
																						suppose your mother has sent me my money. If so,
																						it is very thoughtful of her. If you have brought
																						the money, Susy, you shall have a cup of tea
																						before you start on your homeward walk. It is a
																						fine day, child, and your cheeks look very fresh.
																						Come in, dear; come in."</p>

																					<p>Mrs. Church hobbled back again into her
																						small sitting-room. She got back into her chair,
																						and motioned to Susy to take one opposite to her.</p>

																					<p>"If that is the money you have in your
																						hand," she said, noticing that the child held a
																						small parcel, "you may give it to me, and then go
																						over there and get me that black cash-box. I will
																						put the gold and silver in immediately. It is
																						never safe to leave money about."</p>

																					<p>"But I haven't got the money, Aunt Church.
																						Mother couldn't have saved it in the time."</p>

																					<p>Mrs. Church's face became very bleak and
																						decidedly wintry in appearance.</p>

																					<p>"Then what have you come for, Susan?" she
																						said. "You needn't suppose I am going to waste my
																						good tea on you if you haven't brought the money.
																						If you think so, you are fine and mistaken."</p>

																					<p>"I don't think so, really, Aunt Church; but
																						perhaps when you know all you will give me a cup
																						of tea, and perhaps you won't be so cross the next
																						time I wear my pale-blue blouse."</p>

																					<p>
																						"Ah, my dear, I wasn't cross at the end of the
																						time, al
																						<!-- Page 222 -->
																						<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>though I did
																						think it a bit suspicious: your mother losing
																						nineteen-and-sixpence of my own money out of her
																						till—you forget that fact, Susan Hopkins; it was
																						my money—and then you decking yourself out in the
																						most unsuitable garment I ever saw on a little
																						girl of your age and station. It has pleased the
																						Almighty, Susan, to put you in a low walk of life,
																						and in that walk you ought to remain, and dress
																						according—yes, dress according. But, as I said, I
																						was not displeased at the end. That was a very
																						bonny young lady who came into your mother's
																						shop—miles and miles above you, Susan. And how she
																						can demean herself to call you her friend passes
																						my comprehension."
																					</p>

																					<p>"You are very rude, Aunt Church," said Susy;
																						"but I am not going to be angry with you, for I
																						want you to help us. I have got news for you, and
																						very good news, too. But I will only tell it to
																						you on condition."</p>

																					<p>Mrs. Church looked first skeptical, then
																						curious, then keenly desirous.</p>

																					<p>"Well, child?" she said. "Maybe you might as
																						well put the kettle on the fire; it takes a good
																						long time to boil. It's a very bobbish little
																						kettle, and it has cranky whims just as though it
																						were a human. There's a good child, Susan; take it
																						out and fill it at the tap, and put it on the fire
																						to boil up while you are telling me the rest of
																						the story. I always liked you very well, Susan;
																						not so much as Tom, but you are quite to my
																						liking, all things considered."</p>

																					<p>"No, you never liked me, Aunt Church," said
																						Susy; "but I will fill the kettle if you have a
																						fancy—although perhaps I won't be able to stay to
																						have that cup of tea that you seem all of a sudden
																						willing to give me."</p>

																					<p>Mrs. Church said nothing. Susy left the room
																						with the kettle.</p>

																					<p>
																						<!-- Page 223 -->
																						<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>"I could fly
																						out at her," thought the old lady; "but where's
																						the good? She's hand and glove with that beautiful
																						Miss O'Hara, and for the sake of the young lady I
																						mustn't get her back up too much."
																					</p>

																					<p>So Susy put the kettle on to boil, and then
																						resumed her place opposite Mrs. Church.</p>

																					<p>"Susan," said the old lady, "while the
																						kettle is boiling you might as well lay the cloth
																						and get out the tea-things."</p>

																					<p>"No, no," said Susy; "I haven't come here to
																						act servant to you, Aunt Church."</p>

																					<p>"You have a very nasty manner, Susan; and
																						whatever the Almighty may mean to do with you in
																						the future, you had best change your tune or
																						things will go ill with you."</p>

																					<p>Susy sat quite still, apparently indifferent
																						to these remarks.</p>

																					<p>"Well, if you won't lay the cloth, and won't
																						help your own poor old aunt, you may as well tell
																						me what you came for."</p>

																					<p>"Not yet. I will presently."</p>

																					<p>Susy was now thoroughly enjoying herself.
																						Mrs. Church edged her chair a little nearer; her
																						beady black eyes seemed to read Susy through and
																						through.</p>

																					<p>"Go on, child; speak. 'Tain't right to keep
																						an old body on tenter-hooks."</p>

																					<p>"I will tell you if you will promise me
																						something. I have brought you a little bag that I
																						made my own self, and you shall have it if you
																						promise me something. It is a bag for your
																						knitting. You know you said that you were always
																						losing the ball; it would keep running under your
																						chair, and you could never get it without stooping
																						and hurting yourself."</p>

																					<p>
																						"To be sure I did, child, and it is thoughtful of
																						you to think of me. Well, but we'll talk of the
																						bag when you
																						<!-- Page 224 -->
																						<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a> have said
																						whatever else you have got at the back of that
																						wise little head of yours."
																					</p>

																					<p>"I have got news that may mean a great deal
																						to you, but before I tell it I want you to give me
																						a promise. I want you to let mother off this
																						month's installment of her debt."</p>

																					<p>"What?" cried Mrs. Church, turning very
																						pale. "The money that she owes me?"</p>

																					<p>"Yes, the money she owes you. A thief came
																						into the shop and took some of her money, and she
																						is very short of money and very worried. I will
																						tell you the news if you will forgive mother."</p>

																					<p>"Well," said Mrs. Church, "of all the
																						impertinent, bare-faced, wicked little girls, you
																						beat them all. My answer to that, Susan Hopkins,
																						is no; and you can leave the house, for that is
																						the last word you will get."</p>

																					<p>"Thank you, Aunt Church," said Susy. "I will
																						leave it. It doesn't matter whether you hear the
																						message I have come to give you or not. It is from
																						Miss Kathleen O'Hara, but that don't matter,
																						either. What have you to do with a young lady like
																						Miss Kathleen O'Hara. She's as unsuitable to be
																						with you as she is to be with me. Good-bye, Aunt
																						Church; good-bye."</p>

																					<p>Susy got as far as the door when Mrs. Church
																						called her back.</p>

																					<p>"Come here, you bad little thing," she said.
																						"Sit down on that chair. Now, what do you mean?"</p>

																					<p>"I say I will give you my message if you
																						will forgive mother."</p>

																					<p>"Then I won't. I will never hear your
																						message."</p>

																					<p>"All right, I will go," said Susy. "I'll
																						tell Miss Kathleen; she will be disappointed, so
																						to speak. It was about those almshouses, but—"</p>

																					<p>
																						<!-- Page 225 -->
																						<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>"Look here,
																						child; you tell me first, and then I'll consider."
																					</p>

																					<p>"No, no," said Susy. "I know something
																						better than that. You make the promise first,
																						faithfully and truly, and then I will tell you."</p>

																					<p>After this there was a considerable wrangle
																						between the old woman and the young girl, but all
																						in good time Susy won her desire, and Mrs. Church
																						made the required promise.</p>

																					<p>"Now speak," she said. "There's that kettle
																						singing like mad, and it will boil over in a
																						minute. You shall have a cup of tea and a nice
																						sweet bun with it, and what more can a poor old
																						body like myself offer? What about Miss Kathleen
																						O'Hara?"</p>

																					<p>"Aunt Church, you can help Miss Kathleen,
																						and she is worthy of being helped. She wants you
																						to do something for her."</p>

																					<p>"Me?" said Mrs. Church. "And what can a poor
																						body like me do to help her? Things ought to be
																						the other way round; it's she who ought to help
																						me."</p>

																					<p>"And so she will, and she said as much. She
																						said she'd do what she could to put you into one
																						of those sweet little almshouses; and when Miss
																						Kathleen says a thing she means it. And there's an
																						aunt of hers has come over from Ireland—and from
																						all accounts she must be a perfect wonder—and
																						she's coming, too. Oh, Aunt Church, you are in
																						luck!"</p>

																					<p>"You are enough to distract any one, child.
																						Susy, I told you the kettle would boil before we
																						were ready for tea. Take it off and put it on the
																						hob; and be careful, for goodness' sake, Susy
																						Hopkins, or you'll scald yourself."</p>

																					<p>Susy removed the kettle from its position on
																						the glowing bed of coals, and then resumed her
																						narrative.</p>

																					<p>
																						<!-- Page 226 -->
																						<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>"They're all
																						coming," she said, "and you will have to get them
																						in by hook or crook."
																					</p>

																					<p>"You're enough to deave a body. Who's
																						coming, and where are they coming when they do
																						come?"</p>

																					<p>"They're coming here, Aunt Church, a lot of
																						them—girls like me—big girls and little girls, old
																						girls and young girls, bad girls and good girls;
																						girls who'll laugh at you, and girls who'll
																						respect you; some dressed badly, and some dressed
																						fine. They are all coming, up to forty of them in
																						number, and Miss Kathleen O'Hara is the queen
																						amongst them. Miss Katie O'Flynn is coming, too,
																						and it's to your house they're to come; and it's
																						to happen to-morrow night."</p>

																					<p>"Really, Susy, of all the impertinent
																						children, I do think you beat all. Forty people
																						coming into this tiny house, where we can scarcely
																						turn round with more than two in the house! You
																						are talking pure nonsense, Susan Hopkins, and I'll
																						break my word if that's all you have to tell."</p>

																					<p>"It's true enough. Have you never heard of
																						our society? Well, of course not, so I will tell
																						you. It is this way, Aunt Church: When Miss
																						Kathleen came to the school she took pity on us
																						foundationers. She founded a society, and we used
																						to meet in the old quarry just to the left of
																						Johnson's Field; and right good times we had. She
																						promised us all sorts of things. It was she who
																						gave me that blouse that you seemed to think I had
																						bought with the money which was taken from
																						mother's till. And she gave me this. See, Aunt
																						Church; if you look you will believe."</p>

																					<p>Here Susy pulled from the neck of her dress
																						a little heart-shaped locket with the device and
																						name of the society on it.</p>

																					<p>"Look for yourself," she said.</p>

																					<p>Mrs. Church did look. She put on her
																						spectacles and read the words, "The Wild Irish
																						Girls, October, 18—."</p>

																					<p>
																						<!-- Page 227 -->
																						<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>"Whatever
																						does this mean?" she said. "The Wild Irish Girls!
																						It doesn't sound at all a respectable sort of
																						name."
																					</p>

																					<p>"I am one," said Susy, beginning to skip up
																						and down. "I am a Wild Irish Girl."</p>

																					<p>"That you ain't. You don't know the meaning
																						of the thing. You are nothing but a little,
																						under-bred Cockney."</p>

																					<p>"Thank you, Aunt Church. I do feel obliged
																						for your kind opinion of me. But now, are you
																						going to help Miss Kathleen, or are you not? She
																						can't have the girls—the Wild Irish Girls, I
																						mean—any longer at the quarry, for it's getting
																						noised abroad in the school, and there are those
																						who'd think very little of telling on us; and then
																						we might all be expelled, for it's contrary to the
																						rules of the governors that there should be
																						anything underhand or anything of that sort in the
																						place. So it is this way: we have got into
																						trouble, we Wild Irish Girls, and dear Miss
																						Kathleen is determined that, come what will, the
																						society must not suffer; and she thinks you could
																						help. And if you help in any sort of fashion, why,
																						she'll take precious good care that you get into
																						one of those little almshouses. She said I was to
																						see you to-day, and I was to take her back the
																						answer. And now, will you help or will you not?"</p>

																					<p>"Well, I never!" said Mrs. Church.</p>

																					<p>When she had uttered these words she sank
																						back in her chair. Her knitting was forgotten; her
																						old face looked pale with anxiety.</p>

																					<p>"Have a cup of tea; it will help you to
																						think more than anything," said Susy, and in a
																						brisk and businesslike fashion she dived into the
																						cupboard, took out the cups and saucers, a little
																						box of biscuits, a tiny jug of milk, a caddy of
																						tea, and proceeded to fill the little teapot.
																						By-and-by tea was ready, and Susy brought a cup to
																						the old lady.</p>

																					<p>
																						<!-- Page 228 -->
																						<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>"There, now,"
																						she said. "You see what it means to have a nice
																						little girl like me to wait on you. You'd have
																						taken an hour hobbling round all by yourself. Now
																						what will you do?"
																					</p>

																					<p>"What shall I do?" said Mrs. Church. "Look
																						round, Susan Hopkins, and ask me what I am to do!
																						How many of those forty can be squeezed into this
																						room?"</p>

																					<p>"Let me think," said Susy.</p>

																					<p>She looked round the room, which was really
																						not more than twelve feet square.</p>

																					<p>"We couldn't get many in here," she said.
																						"Four might stand against the wall there, and four
																						there, and so on, but that wouldn't go far when
																						there are forty. We must have the backyard."</p>

																					<p>"What! and upset the pig?" said Mrs. Church.</p>

																					<p>"Oh, Aunt Church, you really can't think of
																						Brownie at a moment like this! They must all
																						congregate in the yard, and you shall look on. Oh,
																						you'll enjoy it fine! But you ought to have tea
																						for Miss O'Hara and Miss Katie O'Flynn; you really
																						ought. Think, Aunt Church; it is quite worth while
																						when you have an almshouse in view; and you know
																						that for all the rest of your life you are to have
																						a house rent-free, coal and light, and six
																						shillings a week."</p>

																					<p>"It's worth an effort," said Mrs. Church;
																						"it is that. But I doubt me, now that the thing
																						seems so near, whether I shall like the crossing.
																						I can't abide finding myself on the salty sea. I
																						have that to think over, and that is against the
																						scheme, Susy Hopkins."</p>

																					<p>"And what do a few hours' misery signify,"
																						said Susy, "when you have all the rest of your
																						life to live in clover?"</p>

																					<p>"That's true—that's true," said the old
																						lady. "If you are positive that it won't upset
																						Brownie—"</p>

																					<p>
																						<!-- Page 229 -->
																						<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>"You can lock
																						Brownie up; I will take charge of the key."
																					</p>

																					<p>"And have him grunting like anything."</p>

																					<p>"He won't be heard with forty of them."</p>

																					<p>"It does sound very insurrectionary and
																						wrong," said Mrs. Church; "but if you are certain
																						sure she will keep her word—"</p>

																					<p>"If I am sure of anybody, it is Miss
																						Kathleen."</p>

																					<p>"She looks a good sort."</p>

																					<p>"And then, you know, Aunty Church, you can
																						clinch matters by having a nice little tea for
																						her; and afterwards, if you don't speak up, I
																						will. I'll tell her you expect to get the
																						almshouse after doing so much as to entertain
																						forty of her guests."</p>

																					<p>"Well, look here, Susy, you have thrust
																						yourself into this matter, and you must help me
																						out. I suppose I must have a tea, but it must be a
																						very plain one."</p>

																					<p>"No; it must be a very nice tea. Oh, I'll
																						see to that. Mother shall send over some things
																						from town—a little pink ham cut very thin, and
																						new-laid eggs—"</p>

																					<p>"And water-cress," said Mrs. Church. "I have
																						a real relish for water-cress, and it's a very
																						long time since I had any."</p>

																					<p>"You have got your own fowls," said Susy,
																						"so they will supply the eggs; and for the rest I
																						will manage. You are very good indeed, aunty, and
																						mother will be so pleased. Kiss me, Aunt Church. I
																						must be off or I'll be getting into a terrible
																						scrape."</p>

																						<h3>RUTH'S TROUBLES AND SUSY'S PREPARATIONS.</h3>


																						<p>The next day the suppressed excitement in
																							the school grew worse. It is sad to relate,
																							nevertheless it is a fact, that Kathleen O'Hara
																							openly neglected her lessons. She kept glancing
																							at Susy Hopkins, and Susy Hopkins once very
																							boldly winked at her; and when she did this one
																							of the under teachers saw her. Now, there were
																							certain rules in the school which all the girls
																							were expected to keep, and winking and making
																							faces were always prohibited. But the teacher on
																							this occasion did not complain of Susy; there
																							were so many other things to be considered that
																							she thought she would let the matter pass.</p>

																						<p>Ruth Craven was in her class, and more than
																							one girl remarked on Ruth's appearance. Her face
																							was ghastly pale, and she looked as though she
																							had been crying very hard. Alice Tennant was also
																							in her class, and she looked very bold and
																							upright and defiant. Nothing ever induced Alice
																							to neglect her studies, for did not the
																							scholarship depend on her doing her very utmost?
																							She worked just as assiduously as though nothing
																							was happening. But each foundation girl—at least
																							each who had joined the Wild Irish Girls—pressed
																							her hand against the front of her dress, so as
																							really to be certain that the little locket, the
																							dear little talisman of her order, was safe in
																							its place; and each girl felt naughty and good at
																							the same time, anxious to please Kathleen and
																							anxious to adhere to the rules of the school, and
																							each girl resolved that, if she had to choose
																							between the school and Kathleen, she would throw
																							the school over and give allegiance to the queen
																							of the society.</p>

																						<p>
																							<!-- Page 231 -->
																							<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>But Ruth's
																							unhappy face certainly attracted attention.
																							Cassandra Weldon noticed it first of all. In
																							recess she went up to her and took her hand.
																						</p>

																						<p>"Ruth," she said, "you must come home with,
																							me to dinner. Afterwards we can have a good chat;
																							and then you shall have a room to yourself in
																							order to work up your lessons for Miss Renshaw.
																							But what is the matter, Ruth? You don't look
																							well."</p>

																						<p>"I am quite well," answered Ruth; "but I
																							don't think I'll be able to come back with you
																							to-day, Cassie."</p>

																						<p>"Oh, what a pity, dear! Is your grandmother
																							ill?"</p>

																						<p>"No; she's quite well."</p>

																						<p>"And your grandfather?"</p>

																						<p>"They are both quite well. It is—no, it's
																							not nothing, for it is something; but I can't
																							tell you. Please don't ask me."</p>

																						<p>"You look very sad."</p>

																						<p>"I feel miserable."</p>

																						<p>"I wonder—" said Cassandra thoughtfully.</p>

																						<p>Ruth looked at her. There was absolute
																							despair in the eyes generally so clear and
																							steadfast and bright. At this moment Kathleen
																							O'Hara was seen passing through the playground in
																							a sort of triumphal progress. She was accompanied
																							by quite a tail of girls: one hung on her right
																							arm, another on her left; a third danced in front
																							of her; and other girls followed in a thick
																							procession.</p>

																						<p>
																							"I feel like a queen-bee that has just swarmed,"
																							she remarked <i>en passant</i> to Cassandra
																							Weldon.
																						</p>

																						<p>Her rude words, the impertinent little toss
																							of her head, and the defiant glance out of her
																							very dark-blue eyes caused Cassandra to stamp her
																							foot.</p>

																						<p>"Ruth," she said, "I don't like your friend
																							Kathleen O'Hara."</p>

																						<p>
																							<!-- Page 232 -->
																							<a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>"But I love
																							her," said Ruth.
																						</p>

																						<p>"That is just it. She makes you all love
																							her and then she gets you into trouble."</p>

																						<p>"But getting into trouble for a friend
																							doesn't make you hate that friend," said Ruth.</p>

																						<p>"Well, I fail to understand her. I agree
																							with Alice Tennant about her. A girl of that
																							sort—fascinating, handsome, dangerous—works havoc
																							in a school."</p>

																						<p>"Listen, Cassie," said Ruth suddenly. "A
																							good many people will be saying bad things about
																							Kathleen before long, and perhaps you will be
																							questioned. I know that Alice Tennant has been
																							questioned already. Will you promise me
																							something, Cassie?"</p>

																						<p>"You look so imploring that I'd like to
																							promise you anything; but what is it?"</p>

																						<p>"Do take her part when the time comes. You
																							are certain to be asked."</p>

																						<p>"But I don't know her. How can I take her
																							part?"</p>

																						<p>"You can say—oh, the kindest things. You
																							can explain that she has always been bright and
																							gay and loving and kind."</p>

																						<p>"I don't know that she has."</p>

																						<p>"Cassie," said Ruth, "your goodness to me
																							has been almost past understanding; but I could
																							hate you if you spoke against her, for I love
																							her."</p>

																						<p>Just then a teacher came out, touched Ruth
																							Craven on her arm, and said:</p>

																						<p>"Will you go at once to see Miss
																							Ravenscroft?"</p>

																						<p>"Why, have you got into a scrape, Ruth? Is
																							that why you look so pale and excited and
																							distressed?" said Cassandra.</p>

																						<p>She spoke in a whisper. Ruth's eyes looked
																							full into hers.</p>

																						<p>
																							<!-- Page 233 -->
																							<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>"God help
																							me," she said under her breath.—"Cassie, if you
																							knew, if you could guess, you'd pity me."
																						</p>

																						<p>Ruth turned away and followed the teacher
																							into the school. A moment later she was standing
																							before the head-mistress.</p>

																						<p>"Now, Ruth," said that lady, "I have given
																							you as long a time as possible. Are you prepared
																							to tell me what you know of the Wild Irish
																							Girls?"</p>

																						<p>Ruth was silent.</p>

																						<p>"I can't give you any further time. There
																							is to be a meeting of the governors at four
																							o'clock this afternoon—a special meeting,
																							convened in a hurry in order to look into this
																							very matter. If you don't tell me in private what
																							you can tell me, I shall be obliged to ask you to
																							appear before the governors. In that case it
																							would be a matter of insurrection on your part,
																							and it is very doubtful if you would be allowed
																							to remain in the school."</p>

																						<p>"It is very cruel to me," began Ruth.</p>

																						<p>"My dear, the path of right is sometimes
																							cruel. We must put this matter down with a strong
																							hand. Do you or do you not know where Kathleen
																							O'Hara and her society are to meet this evening?"</p>

																						<p>"I've been thinking it out," said Ruth; "I
																							have had no one to consult. If I were to tell I
																							should be a traitor to Kathleen. I did not care
																							for the society, although I love her. I joined it
																							at first—I can't quite tell you how—but
																							afterwards I left it. I left it entirely for my
																							own benefit. There is a girl in this school whom
																							you all love and respect. I don't suppose any
																							other girl in the whole school bears such a high
																							character. Her name is Cassandra Weldon."</p>

																						<p>"Of course I know Cassandra Weldon," said
																							the head-mistress. "She is our head girl."</p>

																						<p>
																							"She is; and she is not proud, and she is—oh, so
																							kind!
																							<!-- Page 234 -->
																							<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a> She offered
																							me a very great help. She presented to me a
																							tremendous temptation."
																						</p>

																						<p>"What was that, Ruth?"</p>

																						<p>Miss Ravenscroft began by being cold and
																							indifferent; she was now really interested.</p>

																						<p>"You can sit down if you like," she said.</p>

																						<p>But Ruth did not sit; she only put one
																							pretty little hand on the back of a chair as
																							though to steady herself.</p>

																						<p>"I will tell you everything that concerns
																							myself," she said. "I don't mind how badly you
																							think of me. I had joined the other foundationers
																							as a member of Kathleen's society. Then Cassandra
																							presented the temptation. She offered to give me
																							the services of her coach, Miss Renshaw, to work
																							up for the Ayldice Scholarship. That means sixty
																							pounds a year. We are poor at home, Miss
																							Ravenscroft. My grandfather and grandmother are
																							very poor people; but my father was a gentleman,
																							and my mother was a lady, and their great longing
																							in life was to have me well educated. My
																							grandparents can scarcely afford the expense of
																							keeping me in this school. I know I am a
																							foundationer and my education is free; but there
																							are other small expenses that have to be met.
																							Even for me to live at home is almost more than
																							they can compass. You can therefore imagine the
																							great and wonderful delight of being able to
																							secure a scholarship of sixty pounds a year. I
																							could scarcely have managed it without this help.
																							It was noble of Cassandra to offer it, and I—I
																							accepted it, Miss Ravenscroft. After that, of
																							course, I couldn't remain in Kathleen's society,
																							for Kathleen and Cassandra hate each other, and I
																							couldn't be one moment with one girl and another
																							with the other; so I gave up the society and
																							joined Cassandra. But I can't now betray those
																							who were my friends. I have made up my mind; I
																							can't."</p>

																						<p>
																							<!-- Page 235 -->
																							<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>"You have
																							really made up your mind?"
																						</p>

																						<p>"Quite—quite; indeed I cannot."</p>

																						<p>"Do you know what this means?"</p>

																						<p>"I can guess."</p>

																						<p>"We shall be obliged to call a meeting of
																							the governors. You will be had up before them. If
																							you still persist in keeping your knowledge to
																							yourself they will be obliged to strike your name
																							off the school roll. You will not then be able to
																							get the Ayldice Scholarship. You are a clever
																							girl, Ruth. My dear child, the whole thing is a
																							mistake. You do wrong to conceal insurrection. I
																							can tell your special friend Kathleen, who will
																							no longer be queen of the Wild Irish Girls,
																							to-morrow morning, that I have forced this
																							confession out of you. She will not hate you; she
																							will forgive you. She will understand. My dear,
																							why should you sacrifice everything for the sake
																							of this naughty Irish girl?"</p>

																						<p>"Because I love her, and because it would
																							be mean," answered Ruth, and now she burst into
																							tears.</p>

																						<p>Miss Ravenscroft talked to her a little
																							longer, but Ruth was firm. When she left the
																							head-mistress's presence she felt a certain sense
																							almost of elation.</p>

																						<p>"Now I don't feel so absolutely horrible,"
																							she said to herself. "Of course I will face the
																							governors. I will just say that I know but that I
																							can't tell. Yes, I believe I have done right.
																							Anyhow, I don't feel quite so bad as before I
																							went to see Miss Ravenscroft."</p>

																						<p>Meanwhile Susy Hopkins was having a busy
																							time. She went to school in the morning, but as
																							soon as ever lesson hours were over she flew back
																							to her mother's shop. There Mrs. Hopkins awaited
																							her with a tray full of good things.</p>

																						<p>
																							"Now, Susy," she said, "Tom will help you, for I
																							have got him to promise. He will borrow a
																							wheelbarrow, and all
																							<!-- Page 236 -->
																							<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a> the things
																							can be stacked away tidily into it, and he will
																							take them straight off to Aunt Church's house
																							with you immediately after dinner. You had best
																							spend the afternoon with the old lady and
																							encourage her all you can. It is a blessed relief
																							to have two months of that debt wiped out, and I
																							am very much obliged to you, child, and I will
																							help you all I can."
																						</p>

																						<p>"You can't think how exciting it is,
																							mother," said Susy. "And you know the best of the
																							fun is, they are making no end of a fuss in the
																							school. They're trying to find out all about poor
																							Kathleen's society, in order to put a stop to it
																							and to call the foundationers to order; but the
																							only effect of the fuss is to make more and more
																							of the girls want to join. I saw Kathleen for a
																							few minutes this morning, and she said that she
																							had twelve applications for badges already
																							to-day, but she told the new girls that they had
																							best not come to the meeting to-night, as there
																							wouldn't be room for them. Kathleen is in the
																							highest spirits; she is just laughing and dancing
																							about and looking like a sunbeam."</p>

																						<p>"Dear, dear!" said Mrs. Hopkins. "I do hope
																							it's nothing wicked. You girls of the present day
																							are so queer, there's no being up to half your
																							pranks. It would be a sorry day for me if you
																							were banished from the school, Susy."</p>

																						<p>"Oh, I won't be. It will be all right.
																							Anyhow, this is delicious fun, and I mean to go
																							on with it. What have you got for the old lady's
																							tea, mother?"</p>

																						<p>"Well, now, look here. Of course, she's
																							only going to give tea to Miss O'Hara and Miss
																							O'Flynn—I haven't seen that lady—and yourself and
																							Tom. That's about all."</p>

																						<p>
																							"And Tom will have a pretty keen appetite," said
																							Susy. "I'll tell Miss Kathleen that she is to be
																							at Aunt Church's house quite half-an-hour before
																							the rest of the girls, so
																							<!-- Page 237 -->
																							<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a> that aunty
																							can have her talk with her and arrange about the
																							almshouse, and also that Kathleen and Miss O'Hara
																							may have their meal in comfort. What's the grub,
																							mother? Tell me at once."
																						</p>

																						<p>"Bread-and-butter," said Mrs. Hopkins,
																							beginning to count on her fingers, "a pot of
																							strawberry-jam—"</p>

																						<p>"Oh, golloptious!" burst from Susy.</p>

																						<p>"A plumcake—"</p>

																						<p>"Better and better!" cried Susy.</p>

																						<p>"A little tin of sardines—some ladies are
																							fond of a savory—"</p>

																						<p>"Yes, mother; quite right. And so is aunty,
																							for that matter. You haven't forgotten the
																							water-cress, have you?"</p>

																						<p>"Here's a great bunch of it. You must turn
																							the tap over it and wash it as clean as clean.
																							And what with new-laid eggs, and tea with cream
																							in it, and loaf-sugar, why, I think that's about
																							enough."</p>

																						<p>"So it is, mother; and it's beautiful. But,
																							mother, I do think Aunt Church would relish a
																							pound of sausages. It isn't often she has
																							anything of that kind to eat; she lives very
																							penuriously, you know, mother."</p>

																						<p>"Well, I suppose I can fling in the
																							sausages. I'll just run round to the shop and buy
																							them. Now then, eat your own dinner, Susy, and be
																							quick. Tom has eaten his, and has gone to fetch
																							the wheelbarrow from Dan Smith, the cartwright."</p>

																						<p>Mrs. Hopkins's programme was carried out.
																							Tom arrived at the door with the wheelbarrow
																							about two o'clock. The provisions were stowed
																							safely away in the bottom and covered over with a
																							piece of old matting, and then Tom and Susy
																							started off. Both boy and girl were in high
																							spirits. The day was as fine as it had been on
																							the previous day, and Susy chattered to her
																							heart's content.</p>

																						<p>
																							<!-- Page 238 -->
																							<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>"My word,"
																							said Tom, "I must be in it!"
																						</p>

																						<p>"But you can't, Tom. You are a boy. That
																							would be the final straw. If the ladies of the
																							school and those awful governors were to come
																							along and to see a boy in the midst of forty
																							girls, I do believe we'd all be put in prison.
																							You must clear out, Thomas; make up your mind to
																							that as soon as ever you have handed over the
																							things to Aunt Church."</p>

																						<p>"You wait and see," said Tom. "You may
																							suppose you are a favorite with Aunt Church, but
																							you are nothing at all to me; I can just twist
																							her round my fingers. It's a fine time I mean to
																							have. I won't worry you at all when you are
																							having your commotion in the yard. For the matter
																							of that, I'll creep into the pig-sty with
																							Brownie, and we can look over the doorway."</p>

																						<p>"Oh, Tom, you are certain to be discovered.
																							And you'll just pinch that pig and make him
																							squeal like anything."</p>

																						<p>Tom laughed.</p>

																						<p>"I mean to have my fun," he said; "and
																							don't you suppose for a moment I'm going to funk
																							a lot of stupid, silly girls. How much do you
																							think I'm going to eat, miss?"</p>

																						<p>"I'm sure you are going to be horribly
																							greedy. But perhaps when you see Miss O'Hara and
																							Miss O'Flynn you'll take a fit of shyness. It's
																							to be hoped you will."</p>

																						<p>"Shyness!" cried Tom. "What's that?"</p>

																						<p>"It's what you ought to have, Tom, and it's
																							to be hoped you will have it when the time
																							comes."</p>

																						<p>
																							"Looks like it!" cried Tom, rubbing his hands in
																							a meaning way. "Never frightened of anybody in
																							the whole course of my life. Mean to have a lark
																							with your pretty Miss Kathleen; mean to get a
																							sov. or two out of that charming Miss O'Flynn;
																							mean to coax Aunty Church to give me that
																							microscope when she moves across the sea to
																							<!-- Page 239 -->
																							<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a> Ireland.
																							Tell you, Susy, I'm up to a lark, and the best of
																							the supper goes down my throat. Now you know, and
																							there's no use worriting, for what can't be cured
																							must be endured. Tom Hopkins is part and parcel
																							of this 'ere feast, and the sooner you make up
																							your mind to endure me the better."
																						</p>

																						<p>Susy felt slightly alarmed, but she knew
																							from experience that Tom's bark was worse than
																							his bite; and she trusted to Aunt Church desiring
																							him in a peremptory manner to go when the time
																							approached, and to Tom's being forced to obey
																							her.</p>

																						<p>They arrived in good time at their
																							destination, and Mrs. Church received them
																							figuratively with open arms. And now began the
																							real fuss and the real preparation. Tom took a
																							brush and kicked up, as Aunt Church expressed it,
																							no end of a shindy. The little sitting-room was a
																							cloud of dust. The table, the chairs, and the
																							little sideboard were pushed about; everything
																							seemed to be at a loss until Susy peremptorily
																							took the duster out of Tom's hand and reduced
																							chaos to order. Then the tea was unpacked. A very
																							white cloth from Mrs. Hopkins's most precious
																							store was produced; real silver spoons—from the
																							same source—made their appearance; a few cups and
																							saucers of good old china were added. The table
																							looked, as Tom expressed it, "very genteel." Then
																							the provisions were placed upon the board.</p>

																						<p>
																							"Now we are ready," said Mrs. Church; "and I must
																							say," she added, "that I am pleased. I have known
																							good genteel living in my lifetime, and I expect
																							that Providence means me to know it again before
																							I die. Susy and Tom, you are both good children.
																							You have your spice of wickedness in you, but
																							when all is said and done you mean well, and I
																							may as well promise you both now that when I get
																							<!-- Page 240 -->
																							<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a> to Ireland
																							I will have you over in the holidays. You will
																							enjoy that—won't you, Thomas?"
																						</p>

																						<p>"See if I don't, Aunt Church. And I always
																							was your own boy, wasn't I? And you won't mind,
																							old lady—say you won't mind—leaving me the
																							microscope when you cross the briny? I'm fairly
																							taken with that microscope. I dream of it at
																							night, and think of it every minute of the day."</p>

																						<p>"Come here and look me in the eyes, Tom,"
																							said Mrs. Church.</p>

																						<p>Tom went over. Out of his freckled face
																							there beamed two honest light-blue eyes. His
																							forehead was broad and slightly bulgy; his
																							carroty hair was cut short to his head. Mrs.
																							Church raised her wrinkled old hand and laid it
																							for a minute on Tom's forehead.</p>

																						<p>"You resemble your great-uncle, my
																							husband," she said. "He was the cleverest man I
																							ever came across. He had a real turn for the
																							microscope."</p>

																						<p>"Then, of course, you will leave it behind
																							you; of course you will give it to me," said Tom,
																							quite triumphant with eagerness.</p>

																						<p>"No, my boy, that I won't. If you are a
																							good boy, and do me credit, and get on with your
																							books, and do well in that calling which
																							Providence means you to work in, why, I may leave
																							it to you when I am called hence, Tom."</p>

																						<p>"There, Tom!" said Susy, coming forward.
																							"Don't worry Aunt Church any more. She's got
																							plenty to think about.—Won't you turn him out
																							now, Aunt Church? It is time for you to be
																							dressing, you know."</p>

																						<p>"So it is," said Mrs. Church, looking round
																							her in some alarm. "Whatever is the hour, child?"</p>

																						<p>"It is going on for six o'clock; and they
																							will be here at half-past seven at the latest."</p>

																						<p>
																							<!-- Page 241 -->
																							<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>"Very well,"
																							said Tom; "if I must go I will have a talk with
																							Brownie."
																						</p>

																						<p>He looked at Susy as if he meant to defy
																							her, but Susy was too wise to anger him at that
																							moment. As soon as ever he was out of the house
																							she fetched hot water, soap and a clean towel.
																							Having helped old Mrs. Church with her ablutions,
																							she produced a clean cap and a little black
																							shawl. The old lady said that she felt very smart
																							and refreshed, and altogether in a state to do
																							honor to that dear little almshouse.</p>

																						<p>"I am quite taking to you, Susy," she said.
																							"But I do hope you will marshal those dreadful
																							girls into the backyard without frightening my
																							hens or Brownie."</p>

																						<p>"Pigs aren't remarkable for sensitiveness,"
																							said Susy. "But I tell you what, Aunt Church;
																							Tom's after mischief; he means to witness all the
																							proceedings of dear Miss Kathleen's great
																							society, and we oughtn't to let him. It would do
																							a lot of mischief if the school heard of it, and
																							we would most likely be expelled. He don't mind a
																							word I say, so will you talk to him, aunty?"</p>

																						<p>"But he can't be in the yard without being
																							seen; you say that they are bringing lamps and
																							will make the place as bright as day."</p>

																						<p>"Yes, but he will be in the sty with
																							Brownie; and he as good as said he'd give her a
																							pinch to make her squeal."</p>

																						<p>"Oh, indeed! I'm afraid that must be put a
																							stop to," said the old lady. "Send him to me this
																							minute."</p>

																						<p>Susy went out and called her brother. There
																							was no answer for a minute; then Tom appeared,
																							looking somewhat rakish and disheveled.</p>

																						<p>"Brownie and I were chumming up like
																							anything," he said; then he pushed Susy aside and
																							walked into the old lady's presence.</p>

																						<p>
																							<!-- Page 242 -->
																							<a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>What she
																							said to him even Susy did not hear, but when the
																							little girl returned to Mrs. Church, Tom was

																							<h3>THE GOVERNORS OF THE SCHOOL EXAMINE
																								RUTH.</h3>


																							<p>At four o'clock that afternoon the
																								governors of the Great Shirley School met in the
																								room set aside for the purpose. There were six
																								governors, and they were all ladies. Their names
																								were Miss Mackenzie, Mrs. Naylor, Mrs. Ross, the
																								two Misses Scott, and Miss Jane Smyth. The
																								founders of the Great Shirley School had
																								ordained that it should always be governed by
																								women—that women should conduct its concerns,
																								should see to the best possible education of its
																								pupils, and should manage these things to the
																								best of their ability. Even the trustees of the
																								trust fund were women.</p>

																							<p>
																								Amongst these ladies Miss Mackenzie was reckoned
																								as head. She was a tall, strong-minded woman,
																								with iron-gray hair, false teeth, a prominent
																								nose, and small steel-gray eyes. Miss Mackenzie
																								was between sixty and seventy years of age; she
																								always dressed in the severest and most
																								old-fashioned manner, and wore her iron-gray
																								hair in ringlets on each side of her head. She
																								was an excellent woman of business, and was
																								dreaded not only by the schoolgirls, but also by
																								one or two of the ladies of the committee; those
																								who most feared her were the two Misses Scott
																								and Miss
																								<!-- Page 243 -->
																								<a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a> Jane
																								Smyth. Mrs. Ross was a fashionable woman who
																								went a good deal into London society, talked
																								about the Great Shirley School to her different
																								friends, and was considered an expert on the
																								subject of girls' education. Mrs. Ross had a
																								husband and a beautiful home; she dressed
																								remarkably well, and was looked down on in
																								consequence by Miss Mackenzie. Mrs. Naylor was
																								the oldest of the governors. She was a little,
																								wizened lady with a face like a russet apple, a
																								kindly smile, and a sweet voice.
																							</p>

																							<p>It was the custom of the governors to meet
																								four times a year as a matter of course, and as
																								a matter of expediency they met about as many
																								times again. But a sudden meeting to be convened
																								within forty-eight hours' notice was almost
																								unheard of in their experience.</p>

																							<p>When they were all seated round the table
																								Miss Mackenzie, who was chairwoman, took out the
																								agenda and read its contents aloud. These were
																								brief enough:</p>

																							<p>"To inquire into the insurrection amongst
																								the foundationers, and in particular to cause
																								full investigation to be made with regard to the
																								Irish girl, Kathleen O'Hara."</p>

																							<p>"This is really very astonishing," said
																								Miss Mackenzie, turning to the other governors.
																								"An insurrection amongst the foundationers! Had
																								we not better summon Miss Ravenscroft, who will
																								tell us what she means?"</p>

																							<p>A clerk who attended the meetings (also a
																								woman) went away now to summon Miss Ravenscroft.
																								She appeared in a few minutes, was asked to seat
																								herself, and was requested to give a full
																								explanation. This she did very briefly.</p>

																							<p>
																								"At the beginning of the term," she said, "a
																								girl of the name of Kathleen O'Hara joined our
																								number. She was eccentric and untrained. She
																								came from the south-west of Ireland. I had her
																								examined, and found that she knew
																								<!-- Page 244 -->
																								<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a> extremely
																								little. We were forced to put her into much too
																								low a class for her years and general
																								appearance."
																							</p>

																							<p>"Well," said Miss Smyth, "that, after all,
																								isn't a crime. I don't quite understand."</p>

																							<p>"If you will kindly resume your story we
																								shall be obliged, Miss Ravenscroft," said Miss
																								Mackenzie.</p>

																							<p>Miss Ravenscroft did resume it. She traced
																								Kathleen's conduct from the first day of her
																								arrival to the present hour. Short as the time
																								was—not more than six weeks—she had worked havoc
																								in the school. Her influence was altogether felt
																								amongst the foundationers. They crowded round
																								her at all hours; a glance from her eyes was
																								sufficient to compel them to do exactly what she
																								wished. They ceased to be attentive to their
																								lessons; they were often discovered in school in
																								a state of semi-drowsiness; they were rebellious
																								and impertinent to their teachers—in short, they
																								were in a state of insurrection.</p>

																							<p>"And you trace this disgraceful state of
																								things to the advent of the Irish girl?" said
																								Miss Mackenzie.</p>

																							<p>"I am sorry to say, Miss Mackenzie, that I
																								do. When I noticed that Kathleen O'Hara had a
																								disturbing influence over the girls I caused
																								further inquiries to be made, and I then made a
																								discovery which distressed me very much. My eyes
																								were first opened by the fact that one of our
																								teachers picked up off the floor, just where a
																								certain Clara Sawyer, one of the best and most
																								promising of the foundationers, was sitting, a
																								small locket, evidently a badge. She brought it
																								to me, and I now hand it to you ladies for
																								inspection."</p>

																							<p>
																								The little silver heart-shaped badge was passed
																								from one lady to another. The Misses Scott
																								thought it pretty and quaint. Miss Jane Smyth
																								murmured the words "Wild Irish Girls" under her
																								breath. Mrs. Ross pushed it away
																								<!-- Page 245 -->
																								<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a> from her
																								as though it was beneath notice. Mrs. Naylor
																								said:
																							</p>

																							<p>"Very pretty; quite touching, isn't it?
																								Heart-shaped. I always think that such a sweet
																								emblem, don't you, Miss Mackenzie?"</p>

																							<p>But Miss Mackenzie, with a sniff, took up
																								the little talisman and turned it from right to
																								left.</p>

																							<p>"'Wild Irish Girls,'" she said aloud.
																								"What can this mean?"</p>

																							<p>"I can throw some light on the subject,
																								but not much," said Miss Ravenscroft. "It is
																								quite evident that a society calling itself by
																								this name exists, and that it has been
																								instituted and formed altogether by Kathleen
																								O'Hara, who has induced a great number—I should
																								say fully half—of the foundationers to join her.
																								They meet, I have discovered, at night; their
																								rendezvous being, up to the present, a certain
																								quarry a short distance out of town. What they
																								do at their meetings I cannot tell, but I
																								believe they are very riotous, with singing and
																								dancing and sports of all sorts. Of course, as
																								you know, Miss Mackenzie, such proceedings are
																								altogether prohibited in our school."</p>

																							<p>"But this takes place out of school," said
																								Mrs. Naylor.</p>

																							<p>"Mrs. Naylor, I should be much obliged if
																								you would allow Miss Ravenscroft to continue,"
																								said Miss Mackenzie.</p>

																							<p>Miss Ravenscroft did continue.</p>

																							<p>"Putting aside that question," she said,
																								"the effect on the girls is most disastrous.
																								They are completely out of my control, and I
																								know for a fact that they do not care to please
																								any one except Kathleen O'Hara."</p>

																							<p>"Of course our duty is plain," said Miss
																								Mackenzie. "We must get the ringleader into
																								custody, so to speak, and either bind her over
																								to break up the society, and so keep the peace,
																								or expel her from the school."</p>

																							<p>
																								<!-- Page 246 -->
																								<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>"She is a
																								difficult girl to deal with," said Miss
																								Ravenscroft. "She has a great deal that is good
																								in her; she is handsome and rich, very
																								affectionate, and full of spirit."
																							</p>

																							<p>"But what has a girl who is handsome and
																								rich to do in a school like the Great Shirley?"
																								asked Mrs. Ross.</p>

																							<p>"That is the curious part of it.
																								Kathleen's mother was educated in this school,
																								and she made up her mind that her daughter
																								should never go to any other. Kathleen lives
																								with the Tennants. I should be sorry if she were
																								expelled; there is so much that is good in her.
																								It would be a pity to harden her or hold her up
																								to public disgrace. I hope some other way may be
																								discovered of bringing her to order."</p>

																							<p>"You are quite right. Miss Ravenscroft,"
																								said Miss Smyth. "I never did hold with the
																								severe hardening process."</p>

																							<p>"Certainly in the case of Kathleen it
																								would do no good," said Miss Ravenscroft.</p>

																							<p>"But what do you propose to do, then?"
																								said Miss Mackenzie. "You have not, I presume,
																								asked us to come here without having some plan
																								in your head."</p>

																							<p>"The first thing to do is to get hold of
																								all possible facts," said Miss Ravenscroft.
																								"Now, there is one girl in the school who could
																								tell us—a charming girl, a new girl—for she also
																								only joined this term—but in all respects the
																								opposite of Kathleen O'Hara. She for a short
																								time belonged to the rebels, as I must call the
																								Wild Irish Girls, but she saw the folly of her
																								conduct and left them. She could tell us all
																								about them if she liked, and help us to bring
																								the insurrection to an end."</p>

																							<p>"Then that is capital," said Miss
																								Mackenzie in a tone of enjoyment. "Have the girl
																								summoned, please, Miss Ravenscroft."</p>

																							<p>
																								Miss Ravenscroft turned to the clerk, who went
																								away at
																								<!-- Page 247 -->
																								<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a> once in
																								search of Ruth. Ruth came in looking very white,
																								her face dogged, her usual beauty and charm of
																								manner having quite deserted her. She wore her
																								little school-apron and she kept folding it
																								between her fingers as she stood in the presence
																								of her judges.
																							</p>

																							<p>"Your name?" said Miss Mackenzie.</p>

																							<p>"Ruth Craven."</p>

																							<p>"Your age?"</p>

																							<p>"I am fourteen."</p>

																							<p>"Where do you live?"</p>

																							<p>"In No. 2 Willow Cottages."</p>

																							<p>"Oh, I know," said Miss Mackenzie, looking
																								with more approval at the child. "I have often
																								met your grandfather. You live with him and his
																								wife, don't you?"</p>

																							<p>"Yes, madam."</p>

																							<p>"And you have been admitted here as a
																								foundationer?"</p>

																							<p>"Yes, madam."</p>

																							<p>"In what class is Ruth Craven, Miss
																								Ravenscroft?"</p>

																							<p>"Ruth is a very diligent pupil. She is in
																								the third remove," replied Miss Ravenscroft,
																								looking with kindly eyes at the child.</p>

																							<p>Ruth just glanced at her teacher, and then
																								lowered her eyes. Her beautiful little face was
																								beginning to have its usual effect upon most of
																								the ladies present. Some of the stony despair
																								had left it; the color came and went in her
																								cheeks. She ceased to fiddle with her apron, and
																								clasped her two little white hands tightly
																								together.</p>

																							<p>"My child," said Mrs. Naylor, "your object
																								in coming to school is doubtless the best object
																								of all."</p>

																							<p>Ruth raised inquiring eyes.</p>

																							<p>"I mean," said the little old lady, "that
																								you want to learn all you can—to gain knowledge
																								and wisdom, to learn goodness and forbearance
																								and long-suffering and charity."</p>

																							<p>
																								<!-- Page 248 -->
																								<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>"Oh, yes,"
																								said Ruth, her eyes dilating.
																							</p>

																							<p>"If," continued Miss Mackenzie,
																								interrupting Mrs. Naylor, and speaking in a very
																								firm tone—"if, instead of these pleasant things
																								happening, a little girl learns to join
																								insurrectionists, to forget those to whom she is
																								indebted for such tremendous advantages, then
																								how do matters stand—eh, Ruth Craven?"</p>

																							<p>"I don't understand," said Ruth.</p>

																							<p>Her trembling and fear had come back to
																								her.</p>

																							<p>"The dear child is frightened, Miss
																								Mackenzie," said Mrs. Naylor.</p>

																							<p>"I hope not," said Miss Mackenzie; "but I
																								as chairwoman am obliged to question her.—Ruth
																								Craven, is it true that you became a member of a
																								silly schoolgirl society called the Wild Irish
																								Girls, and that you wore a badge like this?"</p>

																							<p>Ruth nodded.</p>

																							<p>"Don't nod to me. Speak."</p>

																							<p>"It is true," said Ruth.</p>

																							<p>"Are you now a member of that society?"</p>

																							<p>"No."</p>

																							<p>"Why did you join it?"</p>

																							<p>"Because I loved Kathleen O'Hara."</p>

																							<p>"She is the promoter, then?"</p>

																							<p>Ruth was silent.</p>

																							<p>"You have heard me?"</p>

																							<p>"Yes, madam."</p>

																							<p>"Kathleen O'Hara is the promoter?"</p>

																							<p>Again Ruth was silent. Miss Mackenzie
																								glanced at the other ladies. After a pause she
																								continued:</p>

																							<p>
																								"We will leave that matter for the present.
																								Please write down, Miss Judson"—here she turned
																								to the clerk—"that Ruth Craven has refused to
																								answer my question with regard
																								<!-- Page 249 -->
																								<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a> to
																								Kathleen O'Hara. We will return to that point
																								later on.—Why did you leave the society?"
																							</p>

																							<p>"I did so because I wanted to join a
																								scheme proposed by a girl who was not a
																								foundationer and not a member of the society.
																								Her name is Cassandra Weldon."</p>

																							<p>"One of our best and most promising
																								pupils," interrupted Miss Ravenscroft.</p>

																							<p>"I know her," said Miss Mackenzie. "We
																								have every reason to be proud of Cassandra
																								Weldon.—And so she, this charming and excellent
																								Cassandra Weldon, is your friend, little Ruth
																								Craven?"</p>

																							<p>"She has been extremely good to me, madam.
																								She offered me the services of her own coach in
																								order that I might work up for the Ayldice
																								Scholarship."</p>

																							<p>"And do you think you have a chance of
																								getting it?"</p>

																							<p>"I don't know. I mean to try."</p>

																							<p>Her dark-blue eyes flashed with
																								intelligence and longing as she uttered these
																								words.</p>

																							<p>"I think we are now in possession of the
																								facts," said Miss Mackenzie. "Is that not so,
																								Mrs. Ross? Ruth Craven was a member of the
																								objectionable society; she very wisely left it,
																								knowing that she would better herself by doing
																								so.—Now then, Ruth, we expect you to tell us all
																								about the society—where it meets, and as much as
																								you know about its rules. And you must also
																								acquaint us with the names of the girls who are
																								members."</p>

																							<p>Ruth again was silent, but now she held
																								herself erect and looked full at Miss Mackenzie.</p>

																							<p>"You hear me, child. Speak. You can make
																								your narrative brief. Where does the society
																								meet? What does it do? What are its rules? Go
																								on; you are not stupid, are you?"</p>

																							<p>
																								"No, Miss Mackenzie," said Ruth, "I am not
																								stupid;
																								<!-- Page 250 -->
																								<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a> and I am
																								very, sorry indeed to seem rude, but I cannot
																								answer your questions. You know that Kathleen's
																								society exists; that fact I cannot hide from
																								you, but you will not hear anything more from
																								me. It would be a very terrible thing for me to
																								be expelled from this school; it would mean
																								great sorrow to my grandfather and grandmother;
																								but I cannot betray my friend Kathleen, nor any
																								of the other girls of the society."
																							</p>

																							<p>Miss Mackenzie was silent for quite a
																								minute. The other ladies fidgeted as they sat.
																								Ruth, having delivered her soul, looked down.
																								After a long pause Miss Mackenzie said quite
																								gently:</p>

																							<p>"Ruth Craven, you scarcely realize your
																								own position. We cannot possibly let a little
																								girl who is rebellious, who keeps secrets to
																								herself which she ought to tell for the benefit
																								of the school, continue in our midst. We will
																								give you three days to think over this matter.
																								If at the end of three days you are still
																								obstinately silent, there is nothing whatever
																								for it but that you should be expelled from the
																								school. Do you understand what that means?"</p>

																							<p>"It means that I must go, that I shall
																								lose all the advantages," said Ruth.</p>

																							<p>
																								"It means that and more. It means that in the
																								presence of the whole school you are pronounced
																								unworthy, that you leave the school publicly,
																								being desired to do so by your teacher. It is an
																								unpleasant ceremony, and one which you will
																								never be able to forget; it will haunt you for
																								life, Ruth Craven. I trust, however, my dear
																								child, that such extreme measures will not be
																								necessary. You think now that you are honorable
																								in making yourself a martyr, but it is not so.
																								We who are old must know more than you can
																								possibly know, Ruth, with regard to the benefits
																								of a great establishment like this. Insurrection
																								must be put down
																								<!-- Page 251 -->
																								<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a> with a
																								firm hand. You will see for yourself how right
																								we are, and how wrong and silly and childish you
																								are.—Miss Ravenscroft, a special meeting of the
																								governors will take place in this room on
																								Saturday morning. This is Wednesday. Until then
																								we hope that Ruth Craven will carefully consider
																								her conduct, and be prepared to answer the very
																								vital questions which will be put to her.—You
																								can go, Ruth."
																							</p>

																							<p>Ruth left the room.</p>

																							<p>"An extraordinary child," said Miss
																								Mackenzie.</p>

																							<p>"A sweet child, I call her," said Mrs.
																								Naylor. "What a beautiful face!"</p>

																							<p>"My dear Mrs. Naylor, does the beauty of
																								Ruth Craven's face affect this question? She is,
																								in my opinion, extremely silly, and a very
																								naughty child.—Miss Ravenscroft, we leave it to
																								you to bring the little girl to reason. I have
																								known her grandfather ever since he kept a
																								grocer's shop in the High Street. I have
																								respected him more than any man I ever knew.
																								This child in appearance is one of Nature's
																								ladies, but we must get her to see things in the
																								right light, and if necessary she must be made
																								an example of. It will be very painful, but it
																								must be done."</p>

																							<p>"I will do what I can," said Miss
																								Ravenscroft; "but from the little I have seen of
																								Ruth, I imagine she would go to the stake before
																								she would betray those who are kind to her. I
																								will, however, confide in Cassandra; she is
																								extremely fond of Ruth, and she may influence
																								her where others fail. I can't help saying, Miss
																								Mackenzie, that it would be a very terrible
																								thing, and would, I believe much injure the
																								school, if a girl like Ruth were expelled. The
																								other foundationers would feel it; there would
																								be a sense of martyrdom. Sides would be taken
																								for and against her. I trust that this extreme
																								step will not be necessary."</p>

																							<p>
																								<!-- Page 252 -->
																								<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>"If she
																								does not tell us what she knows, it will be not
																								only necessary, but it will be carried into
																								effect, and in my presence," said Miss
																								Mackenzie. "But now to return to the more
																								immediate business. You say these girls meet in
																								a quarry?"
																							</p>

																							<p>"I have heard rumors to that effect."</p>

																							<p>"Do you think they meet there every night?
																								Are their scandalous proceedings a nightly
																								occurrence?"</p>

																							<p>"Oh, no; I do not think they meet oftener
																								than once a week."</p>

																							<p>"Have you any idea what night they
																								choose?"</p>

																							<p>"I am rather under the impression that
																								this is the night."</p>

																							<p>"Then send some one to see, Miss
																								Ravenscroft. One or two of the teachers would be
																								the best. They could go to the quarry to-night
																								and wait there in order to see if the girls
																								arrive. If they do, my orders are that they take
																								no apparent notice of them, but write down the
																								names of all present. If that can be done, and
																								you are successful in finding the girls, we
																								shall have the matter, as it were, in a
																								nutshell, and we shall soon crush this
																								disgraceful rebellion."</p>

																							<p>"And what about Kathleen?" asked Miss
																								Ravenscroft.</p>

																							<p>"There is very little doubt that she will
																								have to be expelled. Such a girl as that is a
																								firebrand in a school, and however rich she may
																								be, and however well-born, the sooner she leaves
																								us the better."</p>

																								<h3>THE SOCIETY MEETS AT MRS. CHURCH'S
																									COTTAGE.</h3>


																								<p>That evening at about a quarter to eight
																									a band of perfectly silent girls might have
																									been seen walking along the road that led to
																									Mrs. Church's cottage. They walked as much as
																									possible on the grass, and glided in single
																									file. Each one, as they expressed it, had her
																									heart in her mouth. Occasionally they looked
																									behind them; sometimes they started at an
																									ordinary shadow, thinking that a policeman at
																									least would be waiting for them. The
																									foundationers who called themselves the Wild
																									Irish Girls had very little doubt what it would
																									mean if their scheme was discovered. They knew,
																									of course, that Miss Ravenscroft would be
																									furiously angry, that the governors would have
																									something to say to them, and that they might
																									be dismissed from the school unless they
																									promised to cease to belong to the society.
																									Perhaps there were worse things than that.
																									There was a timid little girl called Janey
																									Ford, who whispered to her friend that the Wild
																									Irish Girls belonged to the rebels in Ireland,
																									and that it might be considered necessary by
																									the government of the country to have them
																									taken up and put into prison. Nobody for a
																									single moment believed Janey Ford's silly
																									remarks, but nevertheless they gave a sort of
																									thrill to the occasion. It was all delightful,
																									this stealing away in the dark, this pressing
																									one against another as they walked down the
																									little road. And then Kathleen was so
																									fascinating; her eyes were so bright; she was
																									such a valiant sort of leader. If they were men
																									and she was a man, Janey Ford had whispered to
																									her great friend Edith Hart, they would follow
																									her to the death.</p>

																								<p>
																									<!-- Page 254 -->
																									<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>"We'd form
																									a crusade for her," Edith had whispered, back.
																									"She is magnificent."
																								</p>

																								<p>And then both girls felt the little
																									heart-shaped lockets round their necks and
																									thought of themselves as heroines.</p>

																								<p>The entire party, numbering about
																									forty-three in all, arrived at the cottage.
																									Susy suddenly put in her appearance.</p>

																								<p>"Girls," she said, "it isn't at all
																									certain that we are safe. I saw a man going by
																									not ten minutes ago, and he looked suspiciously
																									at the house. Miss Ravenscroft would do
																									anything to catch us; but Aunt Church says that
																									if you go into the yard she doesn't think you
																									will be seen or heard.—May I take the girls
																									into the yard, Kathleen? And may I take you and
																									Miss O'Flynn into the house to see Aunt
																									Church?"</p>

																								<p>Kathleen nodded in reply. She also felt
																									excited and pleased and completely carried out
																									of herself.</p>

																								<p>
																									Susy ushered her visitors with great pride and
																									pomp into Mrs. Church's little sitting-room.
																									Really she felt herself quite rising in the
																									social scale as she saw her old relative
																									dressed in her best, with the manners she used
																									to wear when she was housekeeper at Lord
																									Henshel's, and with that most appetizing, most
																									<i>recherché</i> tea on the table.
																								</p>

																								<p>"I will be back in a minute," said
																									Susy.—"Aunt Church, here they are, and I know
																									you will give them welcome."</p>

																								<p>"I am proud to do that," said Mrs.
																									Church. "I presume I am talking to Miss
																									O'Flynn? Will you take a chair here by the
																									fire, miss? I'm afraid the night is a little
																									bit chilly.—Miss Kathleen, I wish I could get
																									up and offer you a seat, but as it is—"</p>

																								<p>
																									"Oh, nonsense!" said Kathleen. "What are young
																									legs for if not to wait on old legs? Oh, what a
																									heavenly, de
																									<!-- Page 255 -->
																									<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>licious
																									tea! What is that I see? Honey! Oh, don't I
																									just adore honey? Don't you, Aunt Katie?"
																								</p>

																								<p>"That I do," said Miss O'Flynn; "and I
																									eat it comb and all. It never yet disagreed
																									with me; but then I've got the digestion of an
																									ostrich."</p>

																								<p>"Indeed, then, madam, I think you are
																									rather silly to eat the comb," said Mrs.
																									Church; "and you ought always to put butter on
																									your bread when you eat honey. My poor mother
																									told me so, and I have always followed in her
																									steps. If you butter your bread and don't eat
																									the comb, honey agrees with you as well as
																									anything else."</p>

																								<p>"Mrs. Church," said Kathleen, "you are
																									perfectly sweet, and I can't tell you how
																									grateful we are; but we are in something of a
																									hurry, so perhaps you wouldn't mind telling the
																									rest of that story about butter and honey to
																									Aunt Katie when you are in Ireland. Have you
																									made the tea, Mrs. Church? Shall I make it?"</p>

																								<p>"The tea is in that little brown caddy,"
																									said Mrs. Church, "and there's a measuring
																									spoon close to it. I allow—"</p>

																								<p>"Oh, I know," said Kathleen.</p>

																								<p>She began to ladle out spoonful after
																									spoonful and put it into the little brown
																									teapot, which she then filled up with hot
																									water. Mrs. Church looked on with a mingled
																									feeling of approval and disapproval. She was
																									being carried completely off her feet. She to
																									give up her dear little neat house in this
																									reckless way; she to give up her most precious
																									tea to be absolutely wasted and practically
																									lost—for Kathleen put in quite three times too
																									much tea into the little teapot; she to forgive
																									Susy's mother two months of that debt which she
																									owed her. Oh, what did it mean? She was going
																									to be ruined in her old age!</p>

																								<p>
																									"I'd just like to say, miss," she said, looking
																									at Miss
																									<!-- Page 256 -->
																									<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a> O'Flynn
																									and then at Kathleen—"I'd like to say that I am
																									willing to help the young ladies, and the old
																									ladies too for that matter, but I want to know
																									if it is settled that I am to have the
																									almshouse and six shillings a week. I am a
																									plain-spoken body and I'd like to know it; for
																									if so it can be done, I ought to give notice to
																									the landlord of this little house, where I have
																									lived in peace and comfort for over twelve
																									years. I'd like to know, and as soon as
																									possible."
																								</p>

																								<p>"We have written about it, Mrs. Church,"
																									said Miss O'Flynn. "I wrote to my
																									brother-in-law this very day, and I expect an
																									answer soon. Of course, we can't tell you to a
																									certainty whether the house is still to be had,
																									but I didn't hear that it was let. We must hope
																									for the best."</p>

																								<p>"And if it is let," said Kathleen
																									suddenly, running up to the old lady and
																									whispering in her ear, "I'll get Dad to send me
																									a cheque, and you shall have it, so you won't
																									lose one way or the other."</p>

																								<p>This whisper of Kathleen's was very
																									soothing to Mrs. Church. She nodded her head
																									twice and said:</p>

																								<p>"Thank you, dear," and just then Susy
																									returned, and tea began in real earnest.</p>

																								<p>While the ladies were enjoying their meal
																									they did not observe that a round boyish face
																									occasionally appeared at the little glass
																									partition which divided Mrs. Church's
																									sitting-room from her bedroom. The glass
																									reached down about two feet from the ceiling,
																									and was the only light the bedroom had. The
																									boyish face bobbed up now and again, made
																									appealing faces in Mrs. Church's direction, and
																									then disappeared. Mrs. Church shook her head at
																									the apparition, but for a time no one noticed
																									the circumstance. Then Susy began to observe
																									it.</p>

																								<p>"What can it mean?" she thought, and she
																									turned and looked.</p>

																								<p>
																									<!-- Page 257 -->
																									<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>The face
																									appeared, the tongue now stuck into the cheek,
																									one eye winking furiously.
																								</p>

																								<p>"Well, I never!" said Susy.</p>

																								<p>"What are you saying, 'Well, I never!'
																									for?" asked Kathleen. "And why do you and Mrs.
																									Church keep gazing up at that ugly glass across
																									the room? What is the glass for?"</p>

																								<p>"It is the window that lights my bedroom,
																									miss," said Mrs. Church. "And I don't see," she
																									added, "why I may not look at any part of my
																									own house that I take a fancy to."</p>

																								<p>"Of course," said Kathleen. But Tom was
																									now making pantomimic signs for refreshments.
																									He was touching his mouth, which he opened into
																									a round O, pointing at the cake and honey, and
																									going on altogether in a way that distracted
																									poor Susy. And just as Susy looked up Kathleen
																									looked up, and the latter burst into a loud
																									laugh, and said:</p>

																								<p>"I do declare there's a boy in there."</p>

																								<p>The next instant she had burst into the
																									bedroom and dragged Tom out.</p>

																								<p>"Oh, you are Tom Hopkins," she said; "you
																									are Susy's brother. Now sit down here and have
																									a right good meal. It was silly of you to hide
																									in there; as if we minded."</p>

																								<p>"But Kathleen, you ought to mind," said
																									Susy; "for it would be the very last straw if
																									we were discovered and there is a boy found
																									amongst us. I declare I never felt so nervous
																									in my life.—Do go back to the bedroom,
																									Tom.—Aunt Church, oughtn't he to go?"</p>

																								<p>
																									"Come and sit by me," said Mrs. Church. "And
																									here's a fresh egg for you. Take your place,
																									Tom; and when the others go into the yard for
																									their foolish mummeries—for I can't make out
																									that there's a bit of sense in this
																									<!-- Page 258 -->
																									<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a> scheme
																									from first to last—why, you and I will finish
																									up what is left of the good things."
																								</p>

																								<p>"You are a brick, Aunt Church," said Tom.</p>

																								<p>He took a seat at the table, and gazed
																									with wonder, delight, and admiration at
																									Kathleen. He told his school-fellows that at
																									that moment he lost his heart to Kathleen. He
																									said that she bowled him over completely.</p>

																								<p>"I haven't a scrap of heart in my body
																									to-day," he remarked to his chosen friends. "I
																									took it out and put it at her feet; and if
																									you'll believe me, she spurned it. That's the
																									way of girls. Don't you have anything to do
																									with them, boys."</p>

																								<p>But the boys only begged more earnestly
																									than ever to have a look at Kathleen. Tom
																									finally promised to secure her photograph by
																									hook or by crook, and to show it to them.</p>

																								<p>When the meal, which was but a short one
																									after all, came to an end, Miss O'Flynn and
																									Kathleen got up and were preparing to go to the
																									yard at the back of the house, when there came
																									the sound of horse's hoofs on the stones
																									outside. They stopped at the cottage, and a
																									loud knock at the door was next heard.</p>

																								<p>"They have come," said Susy, her face
																									white as a sheet. "I knew they would. I wonder
																									what will happen, Kathleen. Aren't you awfully
																									frightened?"</p>

																								<p>"Not I," said Kathleen. "Why should I be
																									afraid? Whoever is there has nothing to do with
																									us."</p>

																								<p>Susy's state of panic amused both Miss
																									O'Flynn and Kathleen, and Tom was the only one
																									found brave enough to go to the door in answer
																									to the knock. He came back the next instant
																									with a telegram, which was addressed to Miss
																									O'Flynn. She tore it open, and gave a loud
																									scream.</p>

																								<p>
																									<!-- Page 259 -->
																									<a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>"It's my
																									poor cousin Peggy Doharty. She has fallen from
																									her horse and has concussion of the brain. I
																									must go to her at once. Oh, alannah, alannah!
																									What is to be done?"
																								</p>

																								<p>Here Miss O'Flynn turned a face of
																									anguish in Kathleen's direction.</p>

																								<p>"It is I that must leave you, my
																									darling," she said. "I will go back to town
																									with the messenger, get off to London to-night,
																									and cross in the morning. Ah, the creature! And
																									she's my dearest friend. Let us hope that
																									Providence will spare her precious life. Oh
																									dear, dear, dear! This is awful!"</p>

																								<p>"I don't see why you should go, Aunt
																									Katie," said Kathleen. "I want you very badly
																									indeed just now."</p>

																								<p>"Then, my sweet child, come straight away
																									with me to Dublin; for as to leaving Peggy in
																									her hour of extremity, I wouldn't do it even
																									for you, Kathleen, and that's saying a good
																									deal."</p>

																								<p>"But how can I come? I have my society
																									and—and the school."</p>

																								<p>"Well, then, stay, love; only don't keep
																									me now. Good-bye to you, pet; I haven't a
																									minute to lose—Tom—is that your name?—go out
																									and tell the messenger that I will go back with
																									him to Merrifield."</p>

																								<p>"And what about my almshouse?" screamed
																									out Mrs. Church. "This is a nice state of
																									things, I must say. Who minds what a slip of a
																									young lady says?—meaning no offence to you,
																									miss; but I have been spending my money right
																									and left, getting tea that beats all for
																									gentility, and now one of the ladies is off as
																									it were in a flash of an eye. What about my
																									almshouse?"</p>

																								<p>Miss O'Flynn looked rather indignant.</p>

																								<p>
																									"You shall have your almshouse if it can be
																									got. How
																									<!-- Page 260 -->
																									<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a> unfeeling
																									you are to think only of yourself when my
																									dearest friend may be at death's door. Here's a
																									sovereign, which will more than cover the
																									expenses of the tea.—Good-bye, Kathleen, core
																									of my heart.—Good-bye, all of you."
																								</p>

																								<p>Miss O'Flynn flung a sovereign on the
																									table. Mrs. Church made a grab at it, and held
																									it tightly in her hand, which was covered by a
																									black mitten. The next moment the good lady had
																									departed, and Kathleen, looking thoroughly
																									bewildered, was left alone.</p>

																								<p>"Dear, dear!" she said. "Yet I am an
																									Irish girl, and I'm not going to show funk.
																									There are all those poor girls waiting in the
																									yard so long. I will go to them at once. Come
																									with me, Susy."</p>

																								<p>There were about forty girls in the yard,
																									and they sat close together. The night was
																									sufficiently cold to make them somewhat chill,
																									and the fears which little Janey Ford had put
																									into their hearts began to grow greater and
																									more fixed each moment. When Kathleen appeared
																									all was immediately changed. Susy preceded her,
																									carrying the little paraffin lamp. This was
																									placed on the table which was arranged in the
																									yard for the purpose, and its light fell now on
																									the vivid coloring and beautiful face of the
																									Irish girl. She took off her favorite blue
																									velvet cap and pushed her hand through her
																									masses of radiant hair, and then flung herself
																									into what she was pleased to call an attitude,
																									but which was really a very graceful and
																									natural pose. Then she said, speaking aloud:</p>

																								<p>
																									"Girls of the society, Wild Irish Girls, I am
																									sorry to tell you that my aunt, Miss
																									O'Flynn—Miss Katie O'Flynn—who I hoped would
																									have joined our numbers to-night, and would
																									have been a perfect rock of strength for us
																									all, has been obliged to suddenly go back to
																									Ireland,
																									<!-- Page 261 -->
																									<a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a> owing to
																									an accident that has happened to her dearest
																									friend."
																								</p>

																								<p>"Dear, dear, how sad!" said one or two.</p>

																								<p>"So we are without her, girls," continued
																									Kathleen. "And now I want to know if you are
																									prepared to stand by me through thick and
																									thin?"</p>

																								<p>"That we are!" was shouted in one vivid,
																									clear girlish note.</p>

																								<p>"I am glad to hear it. And if you will
																									stand by me, you may be quite sure that I will
																									stand by you. It is whispered in the school
																									that we are found out, and the school, bless
																									it! is angry. It doesn't want us, you
																									foundationers and me, to have our fun—our
																									little bit of innocent fun."</p>

																								<p>"Very mean of it!" said one or two, while
																									the others groaned.</p>

																								<p>"It wants to crush us," continued
																									Kathleen. "We mean the school no harm, and why
																									shouldn't it let us alone? All we want is our
																									fun, a little bit of liberty, and to show those
																									companions who look down upon us that we are as
																									good as they, and that we will fight for each
																									other, and have our own way, and meet when we
																									please, and do as we like out of school hours.
																									It is a sort of Manifesto of Independence, that
																									is what it is, girls, and I want to know if you
																									will stick to it."</p>

																								<p>All the hands were raised up at this
																									juncture, and all the voices said:</p>

																								<p>"Yes, yes, yes."</p>

																								<p>
																									"That's splendid," said Kathleen. "I didn't
																									know I had such an enthusiastic following. Well
																									girls, we'll have to run a certain risk. We
																									will have to conceal all we can about this
																									society; we'll have to be true to each other,
																									whatever happens; and we'll meet wherever we
																									like, girls.
																									<!-- Page 262 -->
																									<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a> Let the
																									head-mistress and the governors say what they
																									please."
																								</p>

																								<p>"Hurrah for Kathleen O'Hara! Hurrah for
																									the Wild Irish Girls for ever!" they shouted.</p>

																								<p>"That's about it," said Kathleen. "I
																									called you all to-night to tell you that we are
																									suspected, and we are called insurrectionists;
																									but let them call us what they like."</p>

																								<p>"Please," here put in the timid voice of
																									Janey Ford, "are we likely to be put in prison?
																									For that would break mother's heart, and do
																									none of us any good."</p>

																								<p>"Oh, you little goose!" cried Kathleen,
																									with her ringing laugh. "Not a bit of it. The
																									worst that could happen to us is to be expelled
																									from the school."</p>

																								<p>Now this worst, which was really a matter
																									of little importance in the eyes of Kathleen,
																									was somewhat serious to the other girls. To be
																									expelled meant to deprive them of their chance
																									of being well educated and of earning a decent
																									living by-and-by. They all felt very grave, and
																									Kathleen, who had a great power of reading what
																									went on in the hearts of those in whom she was
																									interested, felt somehow that their enthusiasm
																									had abated.</p>

																								<p>"But nothing will happen," she cried, "if
																									we are faithful to each other, stand shoulder
																									to shoulder, and do not whatever happens,
																									betray each other. Why girls, Miss Ravenscroft
																									and the governors can do nothing to us unless
																									they have proof, and they will have no proof if
																									we are all true to each other. Now that's the
																									whole of it for to-night. We'll meet in the
																									quarry on Saturday night, and then we'll make a
																									plan for a great expedition all by ourselves to
																									London in the course of next week."</p>

																								<p>"Oh dear," said Susy, "doesn't it make
																									your heart throb?"</p>

																								<p>
																									"And I want to add," continued Kathleen, "that
																									I will
																									<!-- Page 263 -->
																									<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a> frank
																									you. I can't do it always, but I will on this
																									occasion. Aunt Katie O'Flynn has given me some
																									money for that purpose. So you will stick to
																									me, won't you girls?"
																								</p>

																								<p>"That we will!" came from the mouths of
																									all.</p>

																								<p>"And I am your captain, am I not girls?"</p>

																								<p>"Indeed you are. We could die for you,"
																									said one or two. "And we'll never betray you or
																									one another."</p>

																									<h3>RUTH'S HARD CHOICE: SHE CONSULTS HER
																										GRANDFATHER.</h3>


																									<p>The next morning Cassandra Weldon was
																										much surprised, on arriving at the school, to
																										receive a message asking her to step into Miss
																										Ravenscroft's special sanctum. She went there
																										at once, wondering if the head-mistress wanted
																										to give her particular instructions with
																										regard to the great scholarship examination
																										which would take place at the end of the term.
																										Cassandra was remarkable for her calm and
																										somewhat stately bearing; she was the sort of
																										girl who never gave herself away. She was
																										admired rather than passionately loved by her
																										companions. No one could help giving her a
																										most sincere respect. But one or two adored
																										her, and amongst these was Florence Archer, a
																										handsome, bright-faced, original sort of girl
																										who was in the same form as Cassandra.</p>

																									<p>"Be sure you come and tell me afterwards
																										what it all means, Cassie," said Florence,
																										touching her friend affectionately on the
																										shoulder.</p>

																									<p>
																										Cassandra nodded. She did not suppose the
																										matter was of special import. The rest of the
																										girls proceeded to
																										<!-- Page 264 -->
																										<a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a> their
																										different classes, and Cassandra found herself
																										in Miss Ravenscroft's presence. Now to
																										Kathleen the fact of being interviewed by Miss
																										Ravenscroft only caused a sense of annoyance,
																										and unwonted irritation; Ruth was surprised,
																										partly delighted and partly afraid; but
																										Cassandra, whose father had been a teacher,
																										and who lived all her life in the scholastic
																										world, considered it an honor almost too great
																										for words that she should be specially
																										interviewed by so great a person as Miss
																										Ravenscroft. She made, therefore, a most
																										respectful curtsy, and stood modestly before
																										the head-mistress.
																									</p>

																									<p>"Sit down, dear," said Miss Ravenscroft
																										kindly. "I have sent for you, Cassandra,
																										neither to reprove nor to give you ordinary
																										counsel. I have sent for you to consult you,
																										my dear child."</p>

																									<p>"You are very good," said Cassandra,
																										flushing all over her delicate face; "and I am
																										sure," she added, "if it is possible for me to
																										help one like you, I should be only too
																										proud."</p>

																									<p>"That is what I feel; and I think you
																										can help me. We are at present in a very
																										unpleasant position in the school. The
																										unanimity and harmony of this entire large
																										place is in danger, and the foundationers are
																										in extreme peril. You perhaps know to what I
																										allude."</p>

																									<p>"I could not be in the school without
																										having heard rumors of a sort of insurrection
																										which seems to be spreading a good deal," said
																										Cassandra.</p>

																									<p>
																										"Of course," said Miss Ravenscroft. "It has
																										been brought to our ears that a society has
																										been formed by an Irish girl of the name of
																										Kathleen O'Hara. She has called it the Wild
																										Irish Girls. There are several members, and
																										she herself is the leader. Now, Cassandra,
																										without going into particulars, it is the firm
																										intention, not only of myself
																										<!-- Page 265 -->
																										<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a> as
																										head-mistress, but also of the governors, to
																										crush this matter in the bud. It is true that
																										the bud is rapidly blossoming into most
																										dangerous flower and fruit, but if we are in
																										time we shall stop all further mischief. Now
																										to do this we must get all particulars. There
																										is one girl who can furnish us will all we
																										want to know, but she dreads, doubtless from
																										conscientious motives, to betray her late
																										companions. I allude to Ruth Craven."
																									</p>

																									<p>"Poor little Ruth!" said Cassandra. "I
																										thought as much. The child is very unhappy. I
																										take a great—- very great—interest in Ruth,
																										Miss Ravenscroft. She is a most sweet girl;
																										she is a lady placed in a position which a
																										lady should scarcely occupy, but through it
																										all she will never betray the true instincts
																										of her nature."</p>

																									<p>"I am sure of that. I quite like the
																										child myself," said Miss Ravenscroft; "and
																										your opinion of her, Cassie, confirms my own.
																										She told me, too, that you have been extremely
																										kind to her. I quite expect that is the case.
																										But, my dear, the time has come when Ruth will
																										either have to tell us what she knows or to
																										resign her place in the school."</p>

																									<p>Cassandra's face looked troubled.</p>

																									<p>"There are no two opinions on the
																										matter," continued Miss Ravenscroft.
																										"Yesterday a meeting of the governors was
																										convened. They assembled in the
																										committee-room, and I was present. Ruth was
																										sent for and questioned by Miss Mackenzie, our
																										chairwoman. She was asked certain questions,
																										which she absolutely refused to answer. The
																										only thing we could get out of her was that
																										she had been a member of the society but was
																										one no longer."</p>

																									<p>"She left them because of me," said
																										Cassandra. "She felt she could not be with me
																										and with those who do not approve of the
																										paying girls."</p>

																									<p>
																										<!-- Page 266 -->
																										<a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>"There
																										you are!" said Miss Ravenscroft. "Think of the
																										monstrous mischief that is going on in our
																										midst. Children like the foundationers, who
																										are received at the school without being
																										expected to pay anything, who get the most
																										admirable education free of all cost, daring
																										to set up their opinion against girls who,
																										without being in any sense their superiors—one
																										doesn't want to imply that for an instant—are
																										yet vastly superior in numbers. The thing must
																										be put a stop to, and with a high hand; and to
																										show you, my dear, what we mean to do, we have
																										presented an ultimatum to Ruth Craven. She
																										will either tell publicly what she knows of
																										the Wild Irish Girls or be publicly expelled."
																									</p>

																									<p>"Oh, poor Ruth!" said Cassandra.</p>

																									<p>"We are naturally most anxious that such
																										a painful scene should not take place," said
																										Miss Ravenscroft. "I beg of you, therefore,
																										Cassie, to see her and use your influence to
																										induce her, not from quixotic motives, to ruin
																										herself and injure the other girls of the
																										school."</p>

																									<p>"I will do what I can. But Ruth is
																										peculiar. She is, with all her sweetness, very
																										obstinate. Still, I faithfully promise to do
																										what I can."</p>

																									<p>Cassandra left the presence of Miss
																										Ravenscroft and returned to her place in
																										class. Nothing would induce her not to work
																										with her usual diligence, but when on certain
																										occasions she raised her head she saw that
																										Florence Archer was watching her with
																										curiosity and affection, and that Ruth darted
																										quick glances at her and then bent her head,
																										with its curly hair falling over her face, to
																										resume her lessons.</p>

																									<p>
																										This was a half-holiday, and the classes broke
																										up at twelve o'clock. Cassandra hoped to have
																										a talk with Ruth before she went home, but
																										when she looked round for
																										<!-- Page 267 -->
																										<a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a> her
																										little favorite she could not find her
																										anywhere. The foundationers were standing in
																										knots talking eagerly to each other. There was
																										a sort of buzz or whisper going on in their
																										midst. Kathleen O'Hara darted from one group
																										to another, smiled at one set of girls, patted
																										the shoulder of a favorite girl in another
																										group, laughed one time, said an emphatic word
																										to another, and presently disappeared,
																										accompanied by Susy Hopkins.
																									</p>

																									<p>Alice Tennant was standing by herself;
																										she looked dull and depressed. Cassandra went
																										up to her.</p>

																									<p>"It there anything the matter, Alice?"
																										she asked.</p>

																									<p>"Matter!" replied Alice. "Surely you
																										must know that for yourself. Have you not
																										heard what a condition the school is in?"</p>

																									<p>"I have, of course, heard about the Wild
																										Irish Girls," said Cassandra, lowering her
																										voice. "But surely the fact that there are a
																										few naughty girls in our midst need not upset
																										the whole school?"</p>

																									<p>"It upsets me, anyhow," said Alice, "for
																										I feel that I have brought it on the school. I
																										could cry. I only wish that mother had never
																										been induced to take Kathleen as a boarder.
																										She is worse than troublesome; she is a girl
																										without principle."</p>

																									<p>"Oh, I don't think quite so bad as that,
																										dear," said a gay voice at that moment; and
																										turning, Alice saw the piquant and beautiful
																										face of the girl she loathed. "I guessed, of
																										course, that you must be alluding to me," said
																										Kathleen. "I am bad, but I have my own
																										principles—and a good old-fashioned set, worth
																										a great deal."</p>

																									<p>She nodded impertinently to both the
																										girls, and then reentered the school.</p>

																									<p>"I left my satchel and came back for
																										it," she said as she vanished from their view.</p>

																									<p>
																										<!-- Page 268 -->
																										<a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>"Yes,"
																										said Alice, "that is just like her—just the
																										sort of thing she would do. She is always
																										daring every one. I do wish some strong
																										influence could be brought to bear on her.
																										There is no doubt she is very clever, and when
																										she likes she can be extremely agreeable."
																									</p>

																									<p>"She is extremely pretty, you know, and
																										that goes a long way."</p>

																									<p>"Not with me, thank goodness!" said
																										Alice. "In fact, I almost hate her face. I
																										detest people who are always grinning and
																										smiling and showing themselves off. My opinion
																										is that schoolgirls ought to be modest, and
																										attentive to their books, and not thinking of
																										giving themselves airs. But there! no one
																										agrees with me. Mother and the boys are fairly
																										mad on Kathleen; and as to the servants,
																										there's nothing they wouldn't do for her.
																										Every one combines to spoil her; I don't see
																										that she has the least chance."</p>

																									<p>Cassandra talked a little longer to
																										Alice, and then prepared to go home. She was
																										disappointed that she had not seen Ruth; but
																										Ruth had promised to be with her quite early
																										in the afternoon. They were both to work for
																										two hours, and afterwards their coach was to
																										arrive. Ruth would spend the entire afternoon
																										at Cassandra's home. On her way back Florence
																										Archer suddenly joined her.</p>

																									<p>"Now, Cassie," she said, "what is it?"</p>

																									<p>"Oh, can't you guess for yourself, Flo?
																										It is this. The school has got into trouble,
																										and the governors and Miss Ravenscroft mean to
																										sift the matter to the very bottom. It is
																										pretty bad when all things are considered, for
																										if the girls won't tell they will be
																										expelled—expelled without any hope of
																										returning. And I rather fancy Kathleen is the
																										sort of girl whom no one will betray. It is
																										extremely awkward, and I feel very miserable
																										about it."</p>

																									<p>
																										<!-- Page 269 -->
																										<a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>"You look
																										it; and yet it isn't your affair. Your place
																										in the school is secure enough."
																									</p>

																									<p>"What does that matter, Flo, when those
																										you love are in danger?"</p>

																									<p>"Those you love in danger, Cassie! What
																										do you mean now?"</p>

																									<p>"I mean just what I say. I am decidedly
																										fond of little Ruth Craven. She is placed in a
																										hard position, but she is so clever and so
																										pretty that she could do anything. Well, I am
																										certain that Ruth won't betray her
																										companions."</p>

																									<p>"I forgot," said Florence, "that she did
																										belong to that silly society. What a little
																										goose she was!"</p>

																									<p>"She was led into it by Kathleen. They
																										all were for that matter. Kathleen seems to
																										have a singular power over them."</p>

																									<p>"But Ruth doesn't belong to it now."</p>

																									<p>"No. I can't in justice to her explain
																										any further, Florence. I will tell you all I
																										can, of course; but may I say good-bye now,
																										for I have a good deal to do before dinner?"</p>

																									<p>"You are not half as friendly as you
																										used to be," said Florence, pouting. "You
																										hardly ever ask me to your house, and when I
																										ask you to mine you always have an excuse
																										ready. It is somewhat hard on me that Ruth
																										Craven should have come between us."</p>

																									<p>"But she hasn't. I wish that you would
																										believe that she hasn't. I have to give her a
																										sort of protecting love; but you and I, Flo,
																										are equal in our love. Surely we can afford to
																										be kind to a little girl who has not our
																										advantages."</p>

																									<p>
																										"Oh, if you put it in that way, I don't mind a
																										bit,"
																										<!-- Page 270 -->
																										<a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a> said
																										Florence cheerfully. "Well, good-bye for the
																										present. We'll meet to-morrow morning."
																									</p>

																									<p>The girls parted, and Florence went on
																										her way home.</p>

																									<p>Meanwhile Ruth had also gone on her way.
																										She walked slowly. Once or twice she stopped.
																										Once when in a somewhat narrow and lonely path
																										she paused and looked up at the sky, and then
																										down at the ground beneath her feet. Once she
																										uttered a short, expressive sort of sigh; and
																										once she said half-aloud:</p>

																									<p>"I do hope God will help me. I do want
																										to do just what is right."</p>

																									<p>Thus, lagging as she walked, she by slow
																										degrees reached her home. Mrs. Craven happened
																										to be out, but old Mr. Craven was seated by
																										the fire. He was feeling rather poorly to-day.
																										He had a large account-book open in front of
																										him, and when Ruth entered he laid down the
																										pen with which he had been summing up his
																										figures.</p>

																									<p>"I can't make them quite right," he said
																										slowly.</p>

																									<p>"Why, grandfather, what is the matter?"
																										said Ruth in some surprise.</p>

																									<p>The old man's large clear blue eyes were
																										fixed on the child.</p>

																									<p>
																										"I had a curious feeling this morning," he
																										said; "but I know now it was only a dream. I
																										thought I was back in the shop again. I was
																										up, my dear; I had taken a bit of a walk, and
																										I came in and sat down by the fire. It came
																										over me all of a sudden how lazy I was, and
																										how wrong to neglect the shop and not give
																										your grandmother a bit of help with the
																										customers; and so strong was the notion over
																										me that I unlocked the old bureau and took out
																										the account-books. I said to myself I can at
																										least square everything up for her, and that
																										will help her as much as anything. She was
																										always a rare one to see a
																										<!-- Page 271 -->
																										<a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a> good
																										balance at the end of the week. If she had a
																										good balance and all things nicely squared up,
																										we'd have a nice little joint for Sunday; and
																										she'd put on her little bonnet and best
																										mantle, and we'd go for a walk in the country
																										arm-in-arm, just like the Darby and Joan we
																										were, Ruthie, and which we are. But if the
																										balance didn't come out on the right side
																										she'd stay at home. She'd never cry or
																										despair; that wasn't her way, bless you! She'd
																										say, 'We must think of some way of saving,
																										John, or we must do a bit more selling of the
																										stock.' She was a rare one to contrive."
																									</p>

																									<p>Ruth had heard this story of her
																										grandmother many and many a time before, but
																										her grandfather's look frightened her. She
																										went up to him and closed the big
																										account-book.</p>

																									<p>"You have balanced things a long time
																										ago," she said. "Don't fret now. May I put the
																										account-book aside?"</p>

																									<p>"You may, darling; you may. But the
																										accounts ain't balanced, Ruthie; we are on the
																										wrong side of the ledger, my love—on the wrong
																										side of the ledger."</p>

																									<p>Ruth said nothing more. She put the book
																										back into the drawer and locked it. Then she
																										sat down by her grandfather's side.</p>

																									<p>"Would you rather I got you your
																										dinner," she said, "or would you rather I
																										talked to you for a little?"</p>

																									<p>"I'd a sight rather my little Ruth sat
																										near me and let me place my hand on her hair.
																										Your hair is jet-black, Ruthie—almost
																										blue-black. So was your father's hair, my
																										child. He was a very handsome boy. I never
																										looked for it that he would die in the foreign
																										parts and leave you to your grandmother and
																										me. But you have been a rare blessing to us—a
																										rare blessing."</p>

																									<p>
																										"Sometimes I think," said Ruth slowly, "that I
																										have
																										<!-- Page 272 -->
																										<a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a> been a
																										great care. It must have cost you a great deal
																										to feed and clothe me."
																									</p>

																									<p>"No, no, child; far from that. You were
																										always the bit of good luck—on the right side
																										of the balance—always, always."</p>

																									<p>Ruth took the old man's hand and pressed
																										it between both her own. Presently she rubbed
																										her cheeks softly against it.</p>

																									<p>"Grandfather," she said, "are you all
																										right now—quite wide awake, I mean? Has the
																										dream about the shop and the wrong accounts
																										passed out of your head?"</p>

																									<p>"Why, yes, darling; of course it was
																										only a dream."</p>

																									<p>"Then I'd like to ask you something."</p>

																									<p>"Ask away, my little Ruth. You are such
																										a busy little maid now, what with your school,
																										and what with your lessons, and what with that
																										big scholarship—sixty pounds a year. Ah! we
																										shall have a fine right side of the ledger
																										when little Ruth has brought home sixty pounds
																										a year."</p>

																									<p>Ruth stifled a groan.</p>

																									<p>"I am rather puzzled," she said, "and I
																										want to put a question to you."</p>

																									<p>"Yes, my darling; I am prepared to
																										listen."</p>

																									<p>"I know a girl," said Ruth after a
																										pause—she thought that she would tell her
																										story that way—"I know a girl at school, and
																										she has been kindly treated. She is one of the
																										foundation girls, but some of the girls who
																										are not foundationers have singled her out and
																										been specially good to her."</p>

																									<p>"Eh, eh! Well, that's good of them,"
																										said old Mr. Craven.</p>

																									<p>
																										"They have been very good to her; but that
																										Irish girl whom I told you about, she started
																										a society—no special harm in itself—at least
																										it didn't seem harm to the girl
																										<!-- Page 273 -->
																										<a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a> I have
																										been telling you about, and she joined it. She
																										joined it for a bit, and she liked it—that is,
																										on the whole—but afterwards a girl who had not
																										joined the society and did not belong to the
																										foundationers, one whom I am sorry to say the
																										foundationers did not care for at all, offered
																										a great kindness to this girl—a very special
																										and tremendous kindness—and the girl in her
																										own mind decided that she would be doing wrong
																										not to accept it. So she did accept it,
																										and—Are you listening, grandfather?"
																									</p>

																									<p>"Indeed I am, little maid. Go on, my
																										child; I'm attending to every word."</p>

																									<p>"The girl decided to accept the kindness
																										from the paying girl, and to do that she had
																										to give up the society. She was sorry to give
																										it up, but it seemed to her that it was the
																										only right and honorable thing to do. She
																										could not belong to both—to one side of the
																										school and to the other; she must take her
																										stand with one or the other; so she decided
																										for her own special benefit to take her stand
																										with the paying girls."</p>

																									<p>"On the whole, perhaps, she was right,"
																										said the old man. "Can't say unless I know
																										everything; but on the whole, perhaps, she was
																										right."</p>

																									<p>
																										"I think she was, grandfather," said Ruth
																										slowly. "But now please listen. The
																										head-mistress at the school and the governors
																										have found out about the secret society. They
																										have found out that it exists, but they don't
																										know much more. They know, however, that its
																										influence is bad in the school, and they are
																										determined to crush it out. In order to do
																										this they must get full particulars. They must
																										get the name of the leader. I am afraid that
																										they know the name of the leader, but they
																										must also get the names of her companions—all
																										the names—and as much
																										<!-- Page 274 -->
																										<a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a> as
																										possible of the rules of the society. Now the
																										only girl not a member of the society who can
																										give those particulars is the girl I have been
																										talking about; for, of course, she knows, as
																										she belonged to it at one time although she
																										has now left it. And the governors and the
																										head-mistress sent for this girl and asked her
																										to betray her companions—those girls to whom
																										she had sworn fealty—and the girl refused."
																									</p>

																									<p>"Quite right," said old Mr. Craven.</p>

																									<p>The color rushed into Ruth's cheeks. She
																										clasped her grandfather's hand firmly.</p>

																									<p>"She thought it right, but something
																										dreadful is going to happen. It will be
																										terribly hard for the girl if she sticks to
																										her resolve, for the governors of the school
																										have presented what they call an ultimatum to
																										her; they have given her from now till
																										Saturday to make up her mind, and if she
																										refuses on Saturday grandfather, she is to be
																										expelled publicly. Her sentence will be
																										proclaimed in the presence of all the school,
																										and she will be watched walking out of the
																										schoolroom and out of the big gates, which
																										will close behind her for ever, and all her
																										chance goes—all her golden prospects.
																										Nevertheless, grandfather, speaking to me from
																										your own heart, ought the girl to betray her
																										companions?"</p>

																									<p>"Upon my word!" said the old man, who
																										was intensely moved by Ruth's story. It did
																										not occur to him for one moment that the
																										little girl was talking about herself. "I tell
																										you what, Ruth," he said; "I must think over
																										it. I pity that poor girl. I don't think the
																										governors ought to put any girl in such a
																										position."</p>

																									<p>"They are sorry, but they say they must.
																										They must get at the truth; they must crush
																										out the insurrection."</p>

																									<p>
																										"But it is turning king's evidence," said the
																										old man.
																										<!-- Page 275 -->
																										<a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a> "I don't
																										see how a girl is to be expected to betray her
																										companions."
																									</p>

																									<p>"That is the position, grandfather. And
																										now I think I will get you your dinner."</p>

																									<p>Ruth went out of the room into the
																										little kitchen. For a minute she pressed her
																										hands against her face.</p>

																									<p>"Grandfather agrees with me," she said
																										to herself. "I am glad I consulted him. No one
																										ever had a clearer head for business or for
																										right and wrong than grandfather when he is at
																										his best. He was at his best just now. I feel
																										stronger. I won't betray Kathleen O'Hara."</p>

																										<h3>RUTH WILL NOT BETRAY KATHLEEN.</h3>


																										<p>Soon after dinner Ruth walked over to
																											Cassandra's house. Cassandra was so anxious
																											to see her, so determined to use her
																											influence on what she considered the scale of
																											right, that she was waiting for Ruth at the
																											little gate.</p>

																										<p>"Ah! here you are," she said. "I am so
																											glad to see you. Mother has gone out for the
																											day; we will have a whole delightful
																											afternoon to ourselves. We can do some good
																											work."</p>

																										<p>"Let us," said Ruth.</p>

																										<p>
																											She felt feverish and excited. As a rule she
																											was very calm, but now her heart beat too
																											fast. She was thinking of her grandfather,
																											and of what it would mean to him and the old
																											grandmother when she came back on Saturday a
																											disgraced girl, expelled from her high
																											estate, her golden chance snatched from her.
																											Nevertheless she had always been pretty firm,
																											and pretty well resolved to do what she
																											<!-- Page 276 -->
																											<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a> thought
																											right. She was firmer now, and quite
																											resolved.
																										</p>

																										<p>"Shall we go in at once and set to
																											work?" she said. "I want to read that bit of
																											Tasso over again before Miss Renshaw comes."</p>

																										<p>"No, no," said Cassandra. "You are
																											always in such a fidget to learn, Ruth. Come
																											into the garden; I want to talk to you."</p>

																										<p>Ruth looked full round at her
																											companion. She saw something in Cassandra's
																											eye which made her slightly shiver. Then she
																											said:</p>

																										<p>"Very well."</p>

																										<p>Cassandra opened the little gate which
																											led into the tiny fruit and vegetable garden.
																											There was a narrow path, bordered on each
																											side with a box-hedge, down which the girls
																											walked. Presently Cassandra slipped her arm
																											round Ruth's waist.</p>

																										<p>"You knew, of course," she said, "how
																											much I love you."</p>

																										<p>"You are awfully good to me, Cassie."</p>

																										<p>"As a rule I am not fond of what
																											schoolgirls call falling in love," continued
																											Cassandra; "but I love you. There is nothing
																											I wouldn't do for you."</p>

																										<p>"Thank you," said Ruth again.</p>

																										<p>She wondered what Cassandra would say
																											on Saturday. Surely after Saturday no girl
																											who belonged to the Great Shirley School
																											would like to speak to her.</p>

																										<p>"Now I want to tell you something,"
																											continued Cassandra. "I saw Miss Ravenscroft
																											this morning. She told me about you and your
																											position with the governors."</p>

																										<p>"Oh, need we talk of that?" said Ruth
																											coloring, stopping in her walk, and turning
																											to face Cassandra.</p>

																										<p>
																											"Why shouldn't we? I wish you would tell me
																											everything. Why are you going to be so
																											obstinate? But of
																											<!-- Page 277 -->
																											<a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a> course
																											you won't be. You will—you must—change your
																											mind. She told me—Miss Ravenscroft
																											did—because she likes you, Ruth, and she
																											would be so terribly sorry if you got into
																											trouble over this matter. She said you are
																											certain to get into most serious, terrible
																											trouble, for the governors will on no account
																											depart from their firm resolve to expel you
																											from the school. You will have defied their
																											authority, and that is what they cannot
																											permit. It is on that ground they will expel
																											you, but it is strong enough; no one can
																											suppose for a moment that they are acting
																											with injustice."
																										</p>

																										<p>"I am glad it is on that ground," said
																											Ruth softly.</p>

																										<p>"Then of course you will be wise, Ruth.
																											It is silly and quixotic, for the sake of a
																											girl like Kathleen O'Hara, to ruin all your
																											own prospects."</p>

																										<p>"It is scarcely that—and yet it is
																											that," said Ruth slowly. "It is because I
																											will not be a traitor," she added, lowering
																											her voice, then flinging up her head and
																											gazing proudly before her.</p>

																										<p>"I knew you were quixotic. I knew that
																											was at the bottom of it," said Cassandra.
																											"But you will think it over, Ruth. It would
																											be too terrible to see you denounced in the
																											presence of the whole school, and sent out of
																											the school for ever. Think of losing your
																											scholarship. Think of the help you want to
																											give your grandparents. Think of your own
																											future."</p>

																										<p>"I think of them all," said Ruth; "but
																											I also think of what father would have said
																											if he were alive. You see Cassandra, before
																											all things he was a gentleman."</p>

																										<p>Cassandra started. She looked full at
																											Ruth.</p>

																										<p>"Is that a slap at me?" she asked.</p>

																										<p>
																											"No; I did not mean it as a slap at you or
																											anybody. I only see how the matter looks to
																											me, and how it would
																											<!-- Page 278 -->
																											<a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a> have
																											looked to father, and how it looks to
																											grandfather. There are some people born that
																											way; I think, after a fashion, I am one of
																											them. There are others who would look at the
																											thing from a different point of view, but I
																											don't think I envy those others. Shall we go
																											in now and set to work?"
																										</p>

																										<p>"You are an extraordinary girl," said
																											Cassandra. "I really don't know whether I
																											love you or hate you most for being such a
																											little goose. Well, Ruth, if that is your
																											mind, I don't know why you care to go in to
																											work, for it will be all over in a day or
																											two—all over—and your fate sealed."</p>

																										<p>"Nevertheless I should like to read
																											that piece of Tasso, and do my work with Miss
																											Renshaw. Shall we go in?" said Ruth.</p>

																										<p>Cassandra somehow did not dare to say
																											any more. Afterwards, when Ruth had returned
																											to her own home, Cassandra sat with her head
																											in her hands for the best part of an hour.
																											Her mother asked her what ailed her.</p>

																										<p>"I have a headache," she replied. "I
																											was with a girl to-day who is fifty times too
																											good for me."</p>

																										<p>"What nonsense you are talking,
																											Cassandra! There are few people good enough
																											for you."</p>

																										<p>"To think of her gives me a headache,"
																											continued Cassandra. "If you don't mind,
																											mother, I will go to bed now."</p>

																										<p>Meanwhile things were moving rather
																											rapidly in another direction. Kathleen
																											O'Hara, walking home that day in the company
																											of Susy Hopkins, eagerly questioned that
																											young lady.</p>

																										<p>"How prim and proper every one looked
																											in the school to-day!" she said. "What is
																											wrong?"</p>

																										<p>
																											"There is plenty wrong," said Susy. "I tell
																											you what
																											<!-- Page 279 -->
																											<a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a> it is,
																											Kathleen, I feel rather frightened. I suppose
																											it will come to our all being expelled."
																										</p>

																										<p>"Oh, not a bit of it," said Kathleen.</p>

																										<p>"Well, it looks rather like it," said
																											Susy. "Do you know what they are doing?"</p>

																										<p>"What?"</p>

																										<p>"They are bringing pressure to bear
																											upon Ruth Craven. The governors convened a
																											special meeting yesterday; they had Ruth
																											before them, and then tried by every means in
																											their power to get her to tell. You see, she
																											is in the position of the person who knows
																											everything. She belonged to us for a time,
																											and now she doesn't belong to us."</p>

																										<p>"Well?" said Kathleen, feeling
																											interested and a little startled.</p>

																										<p>"She wouldn't tell."</p>

																										<p>"Of course she wouldn't. She is a
																											brick. The Ruth Cravens of the world are not
																											traitors," said Kathleen. "And so that is
																											what the governors are doing—horrid, sneaky,
																											disagreeable things! But they are not going
																											to subdue me, so they needn't think it. I
																											tell you what it is, Susy. Why should we put
																											off till next week our picnic to town? Can't
																											we have it this week?"</p>

																										<p>"I wish we could," said Susy. "It would
																											be glorious," she continued. "I do think
																											somehow, Kathleen, that they will catch us in
																											the long run. It might be dangerous to put
																											off our glorious time till next week."</p>

																										<p>"It might? It certainly would," said
																											Kathleen. "We will go to-morrow evening.
																											School is always over at four. We can meet at
																											the railway station between five and six, and
																											go off all by ourselves to—But where shall we
																											go when we get to town?"</p>

																										<p>"Couldn't we go to a theatre—to the pit
																											at one of the theatres?"</p>

																										<p>
																											<!-- Page 280 -->
																											<a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>"If only
																											Aunt Katie O'Flynn was with us it would be as
																											right as right," said Kathleen; "but dare we
																											go alone?"
																										</p>

																										<p>"I am sure we dare. I shouldn't be
																											frightened. I think some of the girls know
																											exactly how to manage."</p>

																										<p>"Well, I tell you what. You know most
																											of the names of the members. Go round to-day
																											and see as many as you can. Tell them that I
																											am game for a real bit of fun, and that I
																											will stand treat. We will go to town by the
																											quarter-to-six train to-morrow evening. We
																											will have some refreshments at a restaurant,
																											and then we will go to the pit of one of the
																											theatres. It will be a lark. There will be
																											about forty of us altogether."</p>

																										<p>"We are sure to be found out. It is too
																											risky; and yet I think we'll do it," said
																											Susy. "Oh, there never was such a lark!"</p>

																										<p>"Nothing could happen to forty of us,"
																											said Kathleen. "I am going to do it just to
																											defy them. How dare they try to make dear
																											little Ruth betray us? But she won't. I am
																											certain she won't."</p>

																										<p>Susy talked a little longer to
																											Kathleen, and finally agreed to take her
																											message to as many of the Wild Irish Girls as
																											she could possibly reach.</p>

																										<p>"They will all hear of it safe enough,"
																											said Susy. "The whole forty of us will meet
																											you at the station to-morrow night. Oh dear!
																											of course it is wrong."</p>

																										<p>"It is magnificently wrong; that is the
																											glorious part of it," said Kathleen. "Oh
																											dear! I feel almost as jolly as though I were
																											in old Ireland again."</p>

																										<p>She laughed merrily, parted from Susy,
																											and ran all the rest of the way home.</p>

																											<h3>KATHLEEN AND GRANDFATHER CRAVEN.</h3>


																											<p>Friday was emphatically a summer's day
																												in winter. The sky was cloudless; the few
																												leaves that still remained on the trees
																												looked brilliant in their autumn coloring.
																												The ground was crisp under foot; the air was
																												soft, gentle, and pleasant. Girls, like all
																												other creatures, are susceptible to weather;
																												they do their best work and have their best
																												feelings aroused when the sun shines and the
																												day looks cheerful. The sunshiny weather
																												puts heart into them. But it is sad to
																												relate that when a girl is bent on mischief
																												she is even more mischievous, more daring,
																												more defiant when the sun shines and the
																												earth looks gay.</p>

																											<p>Kathleen awoke on the special morning
																												after a night of wild dreams. She raised
																												herself on her elbow and looked across at
																												Alice.</p>

																											<p>"What a lovely day! Why, I see
																												sunshine quite plainly from where I am
																												lying. Wake up, won't you, Alice?" she said.</p>

																											<p>"How tiresome of you to rouse me!"
																												said Alice, opening her eyes and looking
																												crossly at Kathleen.</p>

																											<p>Kathleen smiled back at her. Her face
																												was rosy. Her hair was tossed in wild
																												confusion about her head and shoulders; it
																												tumbled also over her forehead, and made her
																												eyes look more dancing and mischievous than
																												ever beneath its heavy shadow.</p>

																											<p>"I wonder—" said Kathleen softly.</p>

																											<p>If she had spoken in a loud voice
																												Alice would have taken no notice, but there
																												was something pathetic and beautiful in her
																												tone, and Alice raised herself and looked at
																												her.</p>

																											<p>
																												<!-- Page 282 -->
																												<a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>"I
																												wonder," she said "why you hate me so much?'
																											</p>

																											<p>"Fudge!" said Alice.</p>

																											<p>"But Alice, it isn't fudge. Why should
																												I have made myself so terribly obnoxious to
																												you? The others are fond of me; they don't
																												think me perfect—and indeed I don't want
																												them to—but they love me for those qualities
																												in me which are worthy of love."</p>

																											<p>"How you chatter!" said Alice. "I have
																												hitherto failed to perceive the qualities in
																												you that are worthy of love. It wants
																												another quarter of an hour before our hot
																												water is brought in. Do you greatly object
																												to my sleeping during that time?"</p>

																											<p>"No, cross patch," said Kathleen,
																												turning angrily on her pillow. "You may
																												sleep till doomsday as far as I am
																												concerned."</p>

																											<p>"Polite," muttered Alice.</p>

																											<p>She shut her eyes, folded her arms,
																												and prepared for further slumber; but
																												somehow Kathleen had effectually aroused
																												her. She could not get the radiant face out
																												of her head, nor the words, a little sad in
																												their meaning, out of her ears. She looked
																												up as though moved to say something.</p>

																											<p>"As you have asked me a question, I
																												will give you an answer. I know a way in
																												which you can secure my good opinion."</p>

																											<p>"Really!" said Kathleen, who was too
																												angry now to be properly polite. "And what
																												may that way be?"</p>

																											<p>"Why, this: if you will tell the truth
																												about your horrible society, and spare dear
																												little Ruth Craven, and make Cassandra
																												Weldon happy."</p>

																											<p>"I don't care twopence about your
																												tiresome Cassandra; but little Ruth—what
																												ails her?"</p>

																											<p>
																												<!-- Page 283 -->
																												<a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>"The
																												governors are going to insist upon her
																												telling what she knows."
																											</p>

																											<p>"But she won't," said Kathleen,
																												laughing merrily. "She is too much of a
																												brick."</p>

																											<p>"Then she'll be expelled."</p>

																											<p>"What nonsense!"</p>

																											<p>"You wait and see. You don't know the
																												Great Shirley School as well as I do.
																												However, I have spoken; I have nothing more
																												to say. It is time to get up, after all."</p>

																											<p>The girls dressed in silence. Alice
																												had long ceased to torment Kathleen about
																												her own side of the room. Provided Alice's
																												side was left in peace, she determined to
																												shut her eyes to untidy wardrobes, to the
																												chest of drawers full to bursting, to a boot
																												kicked off here and a shoe disporting itself
																												there, to ribbons and laces and
																												handkerchiefs and scarves and blouses
																												scattered on the bed, and even on the floor.
																												Alice had learnt to put up with these
																												things; she turned her back on them, so to
																												speak.</p>

																											<p>
																												The two girls ran downstairs together. Just
																												for a moment Kathleen had felt frightened at
																												Alice's words, but then she cast them from
																												her mind. It was quite, quite impossible to
																												suppose that anything so monstrously unfair
																												as that a little girl should be expelled
																												from the school could happen. Ruth, too, of
																												all the girls—Ruth who was absolutely
																												goodness itself. So Kathleen ate her
																												breakfast with appetite, remarked on the
																												brightness of the day to Mrs. Tennant and
																												the boys, and then with Alice started off to
																												school with her satchel of books slung over
																												her shoulder, her gay, pretty dress making
																												her look a most remarkable figure amongst
																												all the girls who were going towards the
																												great school, and her saucy bright face
																												attracting attention on all sides. There was
																												nothing about Kathleen to indicate that that
																												evening she meant to steal
																												<!-- Page 284 -->
																												<a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a> from
																												home and, in company with forty companions,
																												go to London. She was able to keep her own
																												counsel, and this last daring scheme was
																												locked tightly up in her heart. On her way
																												to school she met Ruth.
																											</p>

																											<p>"There is Ruth," she said, turning to
																												Alice. "Oh! and there's Susy in the
																												distance. I want to speak to them both. You
																												can go on, of course, Alice; I will follow
																												presently."</p>

																											<p>"We are rather late as it is," said
																												Alice. "In addition to your misdemeanors, I
																												should advise you not to be late for prayers
																												just at present."</p>

																											<p>"Thanks so much!" said Kathleen in a
																												sarcastic tone.</p>

																											<p>She left Alice and ran towards Ruth.</p>

																											<p>"Why, Ruth," she said, "you do look
																												pale."</p>

																											<p>"Oh, I am all right," said Ruth,
																												brightening at the sight of Kathleen.</p>

																											<p>"Then you don't look it. Ruth, is it
																												true that they want you to tell?"</p>

																											<p>"They want me to, Kathleen," said
																												Ruth; "but I am not going to. You can rest
																												quite satisfied on that point."</p>

																											<p>"You are a splendid, darling brick,"
																												said Kathleen, "and I love you to
																												distraction. Dear Ruth, what can I do for
																												you?"</p>

																											<p>"Give up the society as fast as you
																												can," said Ruth.</p>

																											<p>"What? And yet you won't tell!"</p>

																											<p>"It's because it's dishonorable to
																												tell," said Ruth. "Don't keep me now,
																												Kathleen; I want to get into school in good
																												time. Grandfather is not well, and I must
																												hurry back to him."</p>

																											<p>"Your nice white-haired grandfather
																												that you have talked to me about?"</p>

																											<p>
																												"He was ill all night. He talked about you a
																												little. Do you know, Kathleen, I think he'd
																												like to see you.
																												<!-- Page 285 -->
																												<a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a> Would
																												you greatly mind coming back with me after
																												school, just to see him for a minute? I have
																												told him so much about you, and I have told
																												granny too, and they both picture you
																												somewhat as you are. Do you think you could
																												come, just to give them both pleasure?"
																											</p>

																											<p>"Come?" said Kathleen gaily. "Why, of
																												course I'll come, heart of my life. I'd do
																												anything on earth to please you. I'll join
																												you after school, and well go straight away.
																												It doesn't matter a bit about my being late
																												for dinner at the Tennants'. Ah! there's
																												Susy. I want to have a word with her."</p>

																											<p>Kathleen pushed past Ruth and ran up
																												to Susy. Susy was looking intensely
																												agitated: there were vivid spots of color on
																												her cheeks, and her eyes were as bright as
																												stars.</p>

																											<p>"I have managed everything," she said
																												in a whisper. "It's all right; it's
																												splendidly right. We are all coming; not one
																												of us will stay behind. We know what it
																												means, of course."</p>

																											<p>"You look very mysterious," said
																												Kathleen. "I wonder why you talk like that.
																												What does it mean, in your opinion?"</p>

																											<p>"Oh, Kathleen, can't you understand?
																												And one does it sometimes in life. I have
																												read about it in story-books, and there are
																												cases of it in history; you have one great
																												tremendous fling; you do what is wrong; you
																												have a good—a very good—time, and you know
																												it won't last; you know that afterwards will
																												come—the deluge."</p>

																											<p>"You are a silly!" said Kathleen.
																												"Why, what could happen? Nobody need know;
																												we will be far too careful for that. I can't
																												tell you how splendidly I have planned
																												things. I have got up my headache already,
																												in order to go to my room and thus avoid all
																												suspicion."</p>

																											<p>"Oh dear!" said Susy. "It doesn't
																												sound right, does it?"</p>

																											<p>
																												<!-- Page 286 -->
																												<a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>"Right
																												or wrong, it is fun," said Kathleen. "I am
																												going to have it so. I have got the money,
																												and I mean to have a magnificent time. Now
																												don't keep me; I must run into school. It is
																												horrid of them to grudge us our little bit
																												of amusement."
																											</p>

																											<p>Susy agreed with her friend; indeed,
																												during those days she was nearly lifted off
																												her feet, so excited was she, so charmed, so
																												altogether amazed at Kathleen O'Hara's
																												condescension to her. Before Kathleen
																												arrived at the school Susy was a good little
																												girl, who helped her mother in the shop, and
																												had dreams of going into another shop
																												herself by-and-by. In those days she did not
																												consider herself a lady, nor expect ladies
																												to take any special notice of her. But those
																												dull and stupid days were no more. Gold and
																												sunshine and rich color and marvellous
																												dreams had all come into her life since the
																												arrival of Kathleen at Merrifield. For
																												Kathleen had discrimination; it mattered
																												nothing to her whether a girl paid or did
																												not pay for her lessons, whether she
																												belonged to the despised foundationers or
																												was respected and looked up to by paying
																												girls. Indeed, if anything, Kathleen had a
																												decided leaning towards the foundationers;
																												and she, Kathleen, was a lady—she belonged
																												to what her mother and Aunt Church called
																												the "real quality." "None of your upstarts,"
																												Aunt Church had said, "but one who for
																												generations has belonged to the aristocrats;
																												and they are of the kind who are too great
																												in themselves to be proud. They are proud in
																												the right way, but they never look down on
																												folks." Yes, Susy was a happy girl now.</p>

																											<p>
																												But, after all, was she quite happy? Was she
																												not at this very minute more or less
																												oppressed by a secret fear? Suppose any
																												single individual in Merrifield heard of the
																												midnight picnic—the great, daring, midnight
																												excursion
																												<!-- Page 287 -->
																												<a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a> into
																												the heart of London. Susy knew far better
																												than Kathleen what a mad action the girls
																												were about to perpetrate. She knew because
																												she lived with the class who discussed such
																												things very openly. If their frolic was not
																												discovered, all would be well; if it was, it
																												would be ruin—ruin complete and absolute.
																												The ladies of the town would fight shy of
																												her mother's shop. Aunt Church would be very
																												unlikely to get her little almshouse in
																												Ireland, for surely even Kathleen's friends
																												would be very angry with her if they knew.
																												Susy herself would be expelled from the
																												school, and she in her fall would bring down
																												her mother and brother. Yes, terrible would
																												be the consequences <i>if</i> they were
																												discovered. But then, they needn't be.
																												Plucky people were not as a rule brought
																												into trouble of that sort. It only needed a
																												brave heart and a firm foot, and courage
																												which nothing could daunt; and the other
																												girls, the thirty-eight who were to join
																												Kathleen and Susy, would keep them company.
																												Nevertheless Susy was as unhappy as she was
																												happy that day. She was so absorbed in her
																												feelings, and in wondering what would happen
																												during the next twenty-four hours, that she
																												was not attentive at her lessons, and did
																												not notice how the teachers watched her and
																												made remarks. It was very evident to an
																												onlooker that the teachers were particularly
																												alert that morning, and that their gaze was
																												principally fixed upon the foundationers.
																											</p>

																											<p>No remarks, however, were made. The
																												school came to an end quite in the usual
																												manner. Immediately afterwards Kathleen
																												dashed off to find Ruth. Ruth was waiting
																												for her just outside the gates.</p>

																											<p>"Here I am," said Kathleen. "Take my
																												arm, won't you, Ruthie? I shall be very glad
																												indeed to be introduced to your
																												grandfather."</p>

																											<p>
																												<!-- Page 288 -->
																												<a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>Ruth
																												made no answer. Her face was white, but this
																												fact only increased the rare delicacy, the
																												sort of fragrance, which her appearance
																												always presented. Kathleen and Ruth, did
																												they but know it, made a most charming
																												contrast as they walked arm-in-arm across
																												the common; for Ruth belonged more or less
																												to the twilight and the evening star, and
																												Kathleen—her face, her eyes, her voice, her
																												actions—spoke to those who had eyes to see
																												of the morning. Kathleen was all enthusiasm,
																												gay life, valor, daring; Ruth's gentle face
																												and quiet voice gave little indication of
																												the real depth of character which lay
																												beneath.
																											</p>

																											<p>"This is such a lovely day," said
																												Kathleen, "and somehow I feel so downright
																												happy. Perhaps I am wrong, perhaps I am
																												right, but I feel happy. I think it is on
																												account of the day."</p>

																											<p>They had now reached the little path
																												which led up to the cottage. Ruth went
																												first, and Kathleen followed. What a tiny
																												place for her darling favorite to live in!
																												But Kathleen felt she loved her all the
																												better for it.</p>

																											<p>Ruth softly unlatched the door and
																												peeped in. The front-door opened right into
																												the kitchen, and Mrs. Craven was seated by
																												the fire.</p>

																											<p>"Hush!" she said, putting her finger
																												to her lips; "he is asleep."</p>

																											<p>"I have brought Kathleen O'Hara,
																												granny. I thought you'd like to see her, and
																												I thought granddad would like to see her."</p>

																											<p>
																												"To be sure, child," said Mrs. Craven,
																												bustling up and removing her cooking-apron.
																												"Bring Miss O'Hara in at once. Is she
																												waiting outside? Where are your manners,
																												Ruth?—Ah, Miss O'Hara, I'm right pleased to
																												see you! I am sorry my dear husband is not
																												as well as could be wished; but perhaps if
																												you'd be good enough to sit
																												<!-- Page 289 -->
																												<a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a> down
																												for a minute or two, he would wake up before
																												you go."
																											</p>

																											<p>Kathleen entered, held out her hand,
																												greeted Mrs. Craven with a frank smile,
																												showing a row of pearly teeth, and then sat
																												down near the fire.</p>

																											<p>"This is cosy," she said. "Aren't you
																												going to give me a little bit of dinner,
																												Mrs. Craven?"</p>

																											<p>"Oh, my dear young lady, but we live
																												so plain!"</p>

																											<p>"And so do I when I am at home," said
																												Kathleen. "I do hate messy dishes. I like
																												potatoes better than anything in the world.
																												Often at home I go off with my boy cousins,
																												and we have such a good feed. I think
																												potatoes are better than anything in the
																												world."</p>

																											<p>"Well, miss, if you'd like a potato
																												it's at your service."</p>

																											<p>"I should if it is in its jacket."</p>

																											<p>"What did you say, miss?"</p>

																											<p>"If the potato is boiled in its
																												jacket. Ah! I see they are. Please let me
																												have one."</p>

																											<p>Kathleen did not wait for Mrs.
																												Craven's reply. She herself fetched a plate
																												and the salt-cellar from the dresser, and
																												putting these on the table, helped herself
																												to a potato from the pot.</p>

																											<p>"Now," she said, "this is good. I can
																												fancy I am back in old Ireland."</p>

																											<p>Mrs. Craven began to laugh.</p>

																											<p>"Ruth, do have a potato with me," said
																												Kathleen; "they are first-rate when you
																												don't put a knife or fork near them."</p>

																											<p>But Ruth had no inclination for
																												potatoes eaten in the Irish way.</p>

																											<p>"I will go in and see how grandfather
																												is, granny," she said, and she disappeared
																												into the little parlor.</p>

																											<p>
																												"You know," said Kathleen, helping herself
																												to a second
																												<!-- Page 290 -->
																												<a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>
																												potato, and fixing her eyes on Mrs. Craven's
																												face—"you know how fond I am of Ruth."
																											</p>

																											<p>"Indeed, my dear young lady, she has
																												been telling me about you; and I am glad you
																												notice her, dear little girl!"</p>

																											<p>"But it is not only I," said Kathleen;
																												"every one in the school likes her. She
																												could be the primest favorite with every one
																												if she only chose. She is so sweetly pretty,
																												too, and such a lady."</p>

																											<p>"Well, dear, her mother was a real
																												lady; and her father was educated by my dear
																												husband, and was in the army."</p>

																											<p>"It doesn't matter if her father was a
																												duke and her mother a dairymaid," said
																												Kathleen with emphasis. "She is just a lady
																												because she is."</p>

																											<p>Before she could add another word Ruth
																												came in.</p>

																											<p>"Do come, Kathleen," she said. "He is
																												much better after his sleep. I told him you
																												were here, and he would like to see you."</p>

																											<p>"He has been bothered like anything
																												about those accounts," said Mrs. Craven. "I
																												can't make out what has put it into his
																												head. Years ago it was an old story with him
																												that something had gone wrong with the
																												books; but, dear hearts! he had forgotten
																												all about it for a weary long while. Now
																												within the last week he has been at it
																												again, just as if 'twas yesterday."</p>

																											<p>"He has an old account-book on the
																												table now, granny," said Ruth.</p>

																											<p>"Well," said Mrs. Craven, "we must
																												humor him.—Don't you take any notice, Miss
																												O'Hara; don't contradict him, I mean."</p>

																											<p>
																												Kathleen nodded. There was a look on Ruth's
																												face which made her feel no longer
																												interested in the Irish potatoes. She
																												slipped her hand inside her friend's, and
																												they went into the parlor. Mr. Craven was
																												seated by the
																												<!-- Page 291 -->
																												<a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a> fire.
																												His white locks fell about his shoulders;
																												there was a faint touch of pink on each of
																												his sallow cheeks, and his blue eyes were
																												bright.
																											</p>

																											<p>"Ah!" he said, raising his face when
																												he saw Kathleen. "And is this the little
																												lady—the dear little lady—- from over the
																												seas, from the heart of Ireland itself? I
																												was once in Ireland. I spent a month in
																												Dublin, and I bought the very best paper for
																												packing my sugars and teas in that I ever
																												came across. Ah! I had a good time. We used
																												to sit in Phoenix Park. I liked Ireland, and
																												I could welcome any Irish maiden.—Give me
																												your hand, missy; I am proud to see you."</p>

																											<p>Kathleen gave her hand. She came up
																												close to the old man and said:</p>

																											<p>"Do you know, you have a look of my
																												own old grandfather. He is dead and in his
																												grave; but he had white, white hair like
																												yours. Do you mind if I put my hand on your
																												hair and stroke it just because of
																												grandfather?"</p>

																											<p>"Ah, my dear, you may do what you
																												like," said the old man. "And you have been
																												good to my little lass—my little woman here.
																												She has told me you have been good to her."</p>

																											<p>"She has been very good to me. I am
																												glad to see you, Mr. Craven. I hope when you
																												get strong again you will come over and stay
																												with father and mother and me at
																												Carrigrohane Castle."</p>

																											<p>
																												"No, no, my love. There was a time when I'd
																												have liked it well, but not now. You see,
																												dear—" his voice faltered and his eyes grew
																												anxious—"I must mind the shop. When a man
																												doesn't attend to his own business, accounts
																												go wrong. Now there was quite a deficiency
																												last week—the wrong side of the ledger. It
																												was really terrible. I think of it at night,
																												and when I wake first thing in the
																												<!-- Page 292 -->
																												<a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>
																												morning I remember it. I must get to my
																												accounts, little miss, but I am right glad
																												to see you."
																											</p>

																											<p>Kathleen felt a lump in her throat.
																												Ruth, with her bright eyes fixed on her
																												grandfather, stood close by.</p>

																											<p>"But there!" said the old man hastily.
																												"It's splendid for Ruth. She's got into that
																												school, and she's trying for a scholarship.
																												I know what Ruth tries for she will get, for
																												her brain is of that fine quality that could
																												not brook defeat, and her mind is of that
																												high order that it must adjust itself to
																												true learning. I was a bit of a scholar when
																												I was young, although I made my money in
																												grocery. Well, well! Ruth is all right. Even
																												if the old man can't square up the ledger,
																												Ruth is as right as right can be. Thank you,
																												Miss—I can't remember your name—- but thank
																												you, little Irish miss, for coming to see
																												me; and good-bye."</p>

																											<p>Kathleen found herself outside the
																												room. Mrs. Craven was not in the kitchen.
																												Ruth and Kathleen went into the garden.</p>

																											<p>"How can you stand it?" said Kathleen.
																												"Doesn't it break your heart to see him?"</p>

																											<p>"Oh no," said Ruth. "You see, I am
																												accustomed to him. He talks like that. I am
																												sorry he is so bothered about the accounts,
																												but perhaps that phase will pass."</p>

																											<p>"He is so pleased about you and the
																												scholarship."</p>

																											<p>"Yes," said Ruth. She turned pale.
																												"Whatever happens," she added, "he must
																												never know."</p>

																											<p>"What do you mean about whatever
																												happens?"</p>

																											<p>"He must never know if I do not get
																												it. Good-bye now, Kathleen. I am glad you
																												have seen grandfather and granny. I must go
																												back to granny now. She is very tired; she
																												gets so little rest at night."</p>

																											<p>
																												Kathleen went slowly home. The meal was over
																												at the
																												<!-- Page 293 -->
																												<a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>
																												Tennants', but somehow her couple of
																												potatoes had satisfied her. She felt much
																												more sober than she had done in the morning;
																												she was inclined to think, to consider her
																												ways. She felt an uncomfortable sensation of
																												being haunted by the faces of Ruth and the
																												old man.
																											</p>

																											<p>"But of course Ruth will get her
																												scholarship," she said to herself. "Of
																												course—of course her grandfather is right.
																												Her brain is of the right order, and her
																												mind is attuned to learning. How nicely he
																												spoke, and how beautiful he looked—how like
																												my dear old grandfather who has been with
																												God for so many years now."</p>

																											<p>There came a loud rat-tat at the
																												front-door. David went out and brought in a
																												telegram. It was addressed to Kathleen. She
																												opened it in some surprise, and read the
																												contents slowly. There was amazement on her
																												face; a feeling of consternation stole into
																												her heart. The telegram, not a long one, was
																												from her father:</p>

																											<div class="blockquot">
																												<p>
																													"Have just seen Aunt Katie O'Flynn. Do not
																													approve of your society. Squash the whole
																													thing at once, or expect my serious
																													displeasure.—<span class="smcap">O'Hara</span>."
																												</p>
																											</div>

																											<p>"Is there an answer?" asked David.</p>

																											<p>"No," said Kathleen. "I mean yes. Yes,
																												I suppose so. Can I have a form? Mrs.
																												Tennant, can I have a telegraph form?"</p>

																											<p>Mrs. Tennant began to hunt about for
																												one. Telegrams were by no means common
																												things at the Tennants' house. David
																												suggested that the messenger boy might have
																												one. This turned out to be the case.
																												Kathleen began to write, but she suddenly
																												changed her mind.</p>

																											<p>"No, no; there is no answer," she
																												said. "I can write by post."</p>

																											<p>
																												She crushed the telegram up and thrust it
																												into her pocket. After this she went out for
																												a little; she was too
																												<!-- Page 294 -->
																												<a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>
																												restless to stay still. The fascination of
																												the coming sport grew greater as obstacles
																												appeared in the way of its realization.
																												Whatever her father might say, she could not
																												desert the girls who belonged to her society
																												now.
																											</p>

																											<p>"What can have ailed Aunt Katie to
																												betray me in such a fashion?" she thought.</p>

																											<p>She came home in time for tea; but, to
																												her amazement she found another telegram
																												waiting for her. This was from Dublin, from
																												Aunt Katie herself:</p>

																											<div class="blockquot">
																												<p>
																													"Have told your father. He received letter
																													from school-mistress this morning. Very
																													angry about Wild Irish Girls. You must give
																													the whole thing up or you will incur his
																													serious displeasure. Don't be a goose; nip
																													the thing in the bud immediately.—<span
																														class="smcap">Aunt Katie</span>."
																												</p>
																											</div>

																											<p>"But indeed I won't," thought
																												Kathleen. "Whatever happens, we will have
																												our fun to-night. Whatever happens, neither
																												father nor Aunt Katie, nor Ruth Craven can
																												keep me back."</p>

																												<h3>KATHLEEN HAS A GOOD TIME IN LONDON.</h3>


																												<p>So the head-mistress had written; she
																													had dared to write to Kathleen's father.
																													What she said to him was a matter of no
																													moment; she had written, and to complain of
																													her!</p>

																												<p>
																													"She thinks, I suppose," said Kathleen,
																													"that she'll subdue me by these means. She
																													wants to bring, not the long arm of the
																													law, but father's arm right across the sea
																													to stop me. No, no, daddy, your Kathleen
																													will be your Kathleen to the end—always
																													loving, always daring, always
																													<!-- Page 295 -->
																													<a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a> true,
																													but always rebellious; the best and the
																													worst. I am going to-night, and I am going
																													all the more surely because you wired to me
																													not to go, and because they are daring to
																													bully dear little Ruth Craven. And after I
																													have had my fling I will come back in good
																													time. No fear; nothing will go wrong. Your
																													Kathleen wouldn't hurt a fly, much less
																													your heart. But I mean to have my fun
																													to-night."
																												</p>

																												<p>Kathleen quite sobered down as these
																													thoughts came to her. It was now getting
																													dusk. The girls were to meet at the station
																													at half-past five. They were to go in quite
																													quietly by twos and twos; each couple of
																													girls was to go to the booking-office and
																													take their tickets, and walk away just as
																													though nothing special had happened. They
																													were on no account to collect in a mass.
																													They were not even to take any notice of
																													each other until they were off. Once the
																													train was in motion all would be safe; they
																													might meet then and talk and be merry to
																													their hearts' content. Oh, it was a good,
																													good time they were about to have!</p>

																												<p>This arrangement about meeting one
																													another had been suggested by Kate Rourke,
																													who knew a good deal about theatres, and
																													who also knew how dangerous it would be for
																													so many girls to be seen at the station
																													together; but dressed quietly, and just
																													dropping in by couples, nobody would remark
																													them.</p>

																												<p>"And then we must go straight to the
																													theatre," she said, "and stand outside the
																													pit, and take our chance; but we will have
																													time enough for that if we leave Merrifield
																													by the quarter-to-six train."</p>

																												<p>
																													Kathleen noticed that evening that Alice
																													watched her as she moved about the room;
																													that Alice occasionally lifted her eyes and
																													glanced at her when she sat down to read;
																													and when she approached the tea-table and
																													helped herself
																													<!-- Page 296 -->
																													<a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a> to
																													tea and bread-and-butter and jam, Alice
																													also kept up that gentle sort of espionage.
																													It annoyed Kathleen; she found herself
																													watching for it. She found herself getting
																													red and annoyed when the calm, steadfast
																													gaze of Alice's brown eyes was fixed on her
																													face. Finally she said:
																												</p>

																												<p>"What are you doing? Why do you stare
																													at me?"</p>

																												<p>"Sorry," replied Alice. She bent over
																													her book, and did not glance again at
																													Kathleen.</p>

																												<p>By-and-by Kathleen went upstairs. She
																													went to their mutual room, and turned the
																													key in the lock.</p>

																												<p>"I must get out of the window," she
																													said to herself. "I can easily do it; it is
																													but to swing on to that thick cord of ivy
																													and I shall reach the ground without the
																													slightest trouble. The back-gate that leads
																													into the garden is never locked, and the
																													window I mean to emerge from looks into the
																													garden. I shall go off without anybody's
																													noticing me."</p>

																												<p>Kathleen had to take a great deal of
																													money with her. If there were forty girls,
																													their tickets would cost a good deal. It is
																													true they were to buy their own in the
																													first instance, but Kathleen was to return
																													them the money in the train. Then the
																													omnibuses they were to go on, the seats at
																													the theatre, their supper of some sort must
																													be paid for by the head of the society.</p>

																												<p>"I promised to frank them, and I must
																													frank them," thought the girl.</p>

																												<p>She slipped some sovereigns into her
																													purse, tucked it for safety into the bosom
																													of her dress, and then put on her hat and
																													jacket. Some instinct told the wild,
																													ignorant child to dress quietly. She put on
																													her plainest hat and a little reefer coat
																													which looked neat and substantial. She was
																													just drawing a pair of gloves on her hands
																													when Alice was heard turning the handle of
																													the door.</p>

																												<p>
																													<!-- Page 297 -->
																													<a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>"Let
																													me in at once, Kathleen," she cried.
																												</p>

																												<p>Kathleen did not reply at all for a
																													moment; then she said in a sleepy,
																													smothered sort of voice which seemed to
																													proceed from the bed:</p>

																												<p>"I have a splitting headache; don't
																													disturb me."</p>

																												<p>"Very sorry," answered Alice, "but I
																													really must come in."</p>

																												<p>Kathleen made no answer. After a long
																													pause, during which Alice once or twice
																													felt the handle of the door again, the
																													sound of her retreating footsteps was
																													heard.</p>

																												<p>"Now is my time," thought Kathleen.</p>

																												<p>To tell the truth, Alice was not at
																													all taken in by Kathleen's headache.</p>

																												<p>"She is very clever," thought that
																													young lady, "but she has tried that dodge
																													on so often before that I am not going to
																													be deceived by it now."</p>

																												<p>
																													Accordingly she went into her mother's room
																													and stood by the window. Now the window of
																													Mrs. Tennant's bedroom looked also into the
																													garden, and was really parallel with the
																													window by which Kathleen meant to escape.
																													There was an interval of silence, and then
																													Alice had her reward! for the window of
																													their mutual bedroom was flung wide open,
																													and Kathleen, neatly dressed, appeared on
																													the window-sill. She looked around her for
																													a minute. Alice caught a glimpse of her
																													bright face by the light of the moon, which
																													was already getting up in the sky. The next
																													minute Kathleen caught firm hold of the arm
																													of old ivy and let herself down deftly and
																													quickly to the ground. The action was done
																													so neatly, and in fact so beautifully, that
																													Alice in spite of herself felt inclined to
																													cry "Bravo!" She knew that if she were to
																													trust herself to that ivy she would
																													probably fall to the bottom and get, if not
																													really killed, at least half so. But
																													Kathleen stood serenely on
																													<!-- Page 298 -->
																													<a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a> the
																													ground, and glanced up at the window from
																													which she had let herself down. Just at
																													that moment Alice rushed into their
																													bedroom. Kathleen had shut the window
																													behind her before she trusted herself to
																													the ivy; she had also unlocked the door. In
																													a moment Alice had put on her hat and
																													jacket, had rushed downstairs, opened the
																													hall door, and was following Kathleen
																													across the common. Now, quite the nearest
																													way to the railway station was across the
																													common. Kathleen walked fast.
																												</p>

																												<p>"Kathleen, Kathleen!" cried Alice.</p>

																												<p>Kathleen looked behind her. She saw
																													Alice, and took to her heels.</p>

																												<p>"No, no, Kathleen; I will follow you
																													until I drop. You must let me come up with
																													you."</p>

																												<p>But Kathleen made no answer. If she
																													could do anything well, she could run in a
																													race. Her swift feet scarcely touched the
																													ground. She ran and ran. How soon would
																													Alice get tired? She did not dare to go to
																													the railway station as long as she was
																													following. And the time to catch the train
																													was very short. At the other side of the
																													common was a long, narrow, winding passage
																													which, after a quarter of a mile of
																													tortuous turning, led right up a back-way
																													to the great terminus. Kathleen had given
																													herself exactly the right length of time.
																													Had nothing happened to hinder her, she
																													would have been on the platform three
																													minutes before the train came in. For
																													reasons of her own she did not wish to be
																													long there. She had crossed the common when
																													she looked behind her; Alice was still
																													running, but she was also in the distance.</p>

																												<p>"If I could only double, hide for a
																													minute, and make her give up the chase, all
																													would be well," thought the mischievous
																													Irish girl.</p>

																												<p>
																													There was a great tree, which cast a huge
																													shadow, just
																													<!-- Page 299 -->
																													<a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>
																													before the winding passage was reached.
																													Kathleen darted towards it. In an instant
																													she had climbed up and was seated securely
																													in one of its lower branches.
																												</p>

																												<p>"Now, if only she will be quick, she
																													will run past me into the passage. She will
																													never get to the end in time. I shall slip
																													down and go the long way. I know it is a
																													good bit farther, but she is not in it with
																													me as far as running is concerned," was
																													Kathleen's thought.</p>

																												<p>Alice came up as far as the tree; she
																													paused a minute and looked around her.
																													Kathleen in the gray darkness looked down
																													at her. Kathleen's face was completely in
																													the shadow, but the light fell full on
																													Alice's, and her face, white and anxious,
																													almost made the other girl laugh.</p>

																												<p>"If the situation wasn't quite so
																													tremendous I could enjoy this," she
																													thought.</p>

																												<p>Presently Alice ran down the passage.
																													Kathleen waited until her footsteps had
																													died away, and then she descended from the
																													oak-tree. She flew as fast as she could the
																													long way to the railway station.</p>

																												<p>"Alice can't think that I want to go
																													by train," thought Kathleen.</p>

																												<p>Now she was truly a very swift
																													runner, but as she was running to-night,
																													whom should she meet but Mrs. Hopkins. Mrs.
																													Hopkins was on her way home after doing a
																													little shopping on her own account. She saw
																													Kathleen, observed her panting for breath,
																													and stood directly in her path.</p>

																												<p>"Miss O'Hara," she said, "can I speak
																													to you for a moment? It is something very
																													particular indeed. I am very thankful I
																													happened to meet you."</p>

																												<p>"I will see you to-morrow—to-morrow,"
																													panted Kathleen. "I am in a great hurry.
																													To-morrow, Mrs. Hopkins."</p>

																												<p>
																													<!-- Page 300 -->
																													<a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a>"No,
																													Miss O'Hara; it ought to be to-night. You
																													are going to the railway station, aren't
																													you, miss?"
																												</p>

																												<p>Kathleen felt inclined to knock that
																													interfering woman down. She darted to one
																													side of the road.</p>

																												<p>"Oh, let me pass!" she said. She was
																													shaking with her quick run. She knew the
																													moments were flying; already she heard the
																													bell at the station ring. The train for
																													London was signaled; she had not an instant
																													to lose.</p>

																												<p>"Don't—don't keep me," she said.</p>

																												<p>"But you mustn't go, miss; it would
																													be madness—wicked. You musn't; you
																													daren't."</p>

																												<p>Kathleen pushed past her. This time
																													Mrs. Hopkins had no power to stop her. She
																													rushed on, reached the station, flew up the
																													steps, and found herself on the platform
																													just as the train was coming in.</p>

																												<p>Instead of the forty girls she
																													expected to meet, she saw not more than
																													about half-a-dozen. They all crowded up to
																													her at once.</p>

																												<p>"I have got your ticket for you,"
																													said Susy. "I was just able to screw out
																													the money to get one for you and myself.
																													Here's the train; let us hop in at once."</p>

																												<p>"But where are all the others—the
																													forty?" gasped Kathleen.</p>

																												<p>"They funked it, almost all of them.
																													Oh! come along; here's the train."</p>

																												<p>The great train thundered into the
																													station. The girls ran wildly looking for a
																													third-class carriage. At last they found
																													one and tumbled into it; the door was
																													slammed, and they were off. Kathleen
																													wondered—she was not sure, but she
																													wondered—if she really did see, or if it
																													was only a dream, a pair of brown eyes
																													looking at her from the station, and the
																													severe young figure and shocked face of
																													Alice Tennant.</p>

																												<p>
																													<!-- Page 301 -->
																													<a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>"It
																													must have been a dream; she could not have
																													guessed that I was going to the station.
																													What a good thing she didn't meet Mrs.
																													Hopkins!" thought Kathleen. Then she turned
																													to her companions—to the six girls who had
																													decided to brave all the terrors of their
																													expedition. They were Susy Hopkins, Kate
																													Rourke, Clara Sawyer, Rosy Myers, Janey
																													Ford, and Mary Wilkins.
																												</p>

																												<p>Kathleen sat quite still for a minute
																													until she had recovered her breath. She
																													looked around her. To her relief, she saw
																													that they were alone. There was no one else
																													in the compartment.</p>

																												<p>"Now then," she said, "how is it that
																													all the others have funked it?"</p>

																												<p>"There has been so much muttering and
																													whispering and suspecting going on during
																													the whole livelong day that they were
																													positively afraid," said Susy. "Indeed, if
																													it hadn't been for you, Kathleen, I doubt
																													if any of us would have come."</p>

																												<p>"Well, girls, we can't help it," said
																													Kathleen. "If the rest are so timid,
																													there's more fun for us; isn't that so?"</p>

																												<p>She looked round at her companions.</p>

																												<p>"I mean to enjoy myself," said Kate
																													Rourke. "I have been to a theater twice
																													before. Once I went with my grandfather,
																													and another time with an uncle from
																													Australia. I didn't go to the pit when I
																													went with uncle. He took me to a grand
																													stall, and we rubbed up against the
																													nobility, I can tell you."</p>

																												<p>It suddenly occurred to Kathleen that
																													Kate Rourke was rather a vulgar girl. She
																													drew a little nearer to her, however, and
																													fixed her very bright eyes on the girl's
																													face."</p>

																												<p>
																													"But we needn't go to the pit, need we?"
																													she said. "I meant to pay for forty. If
																													there are only six, why shouldn't
																													<!-- Page 302 -->
																													<a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a> we
																													have jolly seats somewhere, and not waste
																													our time outside the theater?"
																												</p>

																												<p>"That would be nice," said Kate
																													Rourke. "I always enjoy myself so much more
																													if I am in good company. I have been
																													looking up the plays at the theaters, and
																													there is a very fine piece on at the
																													Princess'. That is in Oxford Street. It is
																													a sort of melodrama; there's a deal of
																													killing in it, and the heroine has to do
																													some desperate deeds."</p>

																												<p>"Oh, dear!" said Susy, with a sigh;
																													"I don't feel, somehow, as if I much cared
																													where we went. It will be awful afterwards
																													when the fun is over."</p>

																												<p>"But we will enjoy ourselves, Susy,
																													while the fun lasts," said Kathleen. She
																													tried to believe that she was enjoying
																													herself and was having a right good time.
																													She tried to forget the fact that Alice
																													Tennant might really have seen her off, and
																													that Mrs. Hopkins had justice in her
																													remarks when she begged and implored of
																													Kathleen not to go to the train.</p>

																												<p>"What can she have found out?" she
																													thought.</p>

																												<p>She now turned to Susy.</p>

																												<p>"Has your mother learned anything,
																													Susy?" she said.</p>

																												<p>"What do you mean?" said Susy,
																													turning very pink.</p>

																												<p>"Well, you know, as I was running
																													here—Oh, girls, I had such a lark! What do
																													you think happened? That horrid Alice—Alice
																													Tennant—ran after me as I was leaving the
																													house. I raced her across the common, and
																													then to get rid of her I climbed up into an
																													oak-tree. She never saw me, and ran on down
																													the passage. Of course, my only chance of
																													getting to the station was to go by the
																													long way.—Half-way there I came across your
																													mother, Susy, and she tried to stop me, and
																													said she must speak to me. Dear, she did
																													seem in a state! Evidently there's a great
																													deal of excitement and watching going on in
																													that school."</p>

																												<p>
																													<!-- Page 303 -->
																													<a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a>"There
																													will be a great deal of excitement
																													to-morrow," said Susy. "It strikes me it
																													will be all up with us to-morrow—that is,
																													if Ruth tells."
																												</p>

																												<p>"If Ruth tells! What do you mean?"</p>

																												<p>"They are going to do their utmost to
																													get her to tell; and if she does tell they
																													will call out our names and expel us,
																													that's all. Oh! I can't bear to think of
																													it—I can't bear to think of it."</p>

																												<p>Susy's voice broke. Tears trembled in
																													her bright black eyes, and she turned her
																													head to one side. Kathleen gave her a quick
																													glance.</p>

																												<p>"It will be all right," she said.
																													"Ruth won't tell. Ruth is the kind who
																													never tells. She told me to-day she
																													wouldn't."</p>

																												<p>"She'll be a brick if she doesn't,"
																													said Kate Rourke. "But then, of course, you
																													know—"</p>

																												<p>"I know what?"</p>

																												<p>"Oh, nothing. What's the good of
																													making ourselves melancholy on a night like
																													this?"</p>

																												<p>"If I were expelled," said Clara
																													Sawyer, "I should leave Merrifield. I could
																													never lift up my head again. You can't
																													think what impudent sort of boys my
																													brothers are, and they have always twitted
																													me for my good fortune in getting into the
																													Great Shirley School. They say that if we
																													are to be expelled it will be done in
																													public. The governors are determined to
																													read us a lesson. That's what they say."</p>

																												<p>"Who cares what they say?" said
																													Kathleen. "Let them say."</p>

																												<p>"Well, that's what I think; and I
																													dare say half of it is untrue," said little
																													Janey Ford.</p>

																												<p>
																													"I am sure, Janey, wonders will never cease
																													when we see you in this thing," said Susy.
																													"It was disgusting of
																													<!-- Page 304 -->
																													<a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a> the
																													others to funk it. But I suppose they were
																													on the right side; only I do sometimes hate
																													being on the right side.—Don't you,
																													Kathleen?"
																												</p>

																												<p>"Yes," said Kathleen in a whisper,
																													and she squeezed Susy's hand. It seemed to
																													her that her soul and Susy's had met at
																													that moment, and had saluted each other
																													like comrades true.</p>

																												<p>"But how was it you came, Janey?
																													Didn't your little heart funk it
																													altogether?" continued Kate.</p>

																												<p>"I was so mad to come," said Janey.
																													"I am shaking and trembling now like
																													anything. But I had never been to a
																													theater, and it was such a tremendous
																													temptation. I said about ten times to
																													myself that I wouldn't come, but eleven
																													times I said that I would; and the eleventh
																													time conquered, and here I am. I do hope
																													we'll have a right good time."</p>

																												<p>
																													With this sort of chatter the girls got to
																													London. Here Kate Rourke took the lead. She
																													marshaled the little party in two and two,
																													and so conveyed them out of the station.
																													Outside the yard at Charing Cross they all
																													climbed on the top of an omnibus, and soon
																													were wending their way in the direction of
																													the Princess' Theater, which Kate most
																													strongly advocated. There was no crowd at
																													the theater this special evening. The piece
																													which was presented on the boards happened
																													to be a fairly good one. The girls got
																													excellent seats, and found themselves in
																													the front row of the family circle. From
																													there they could look down on dazzling
																													scenes, and Kathleen, who had never been to
																													a theater in the whole course of her life,
																													was delighted. She at least had forgotten
																													what might follow this expedition. Oh, yes,
																													they were having a glorious time; and it
																													was quite right to do what you liked
																													sometimes, and quite right to defy your
																													elders. Oh, how many she was
																													<!-- Page 305 -->
																													<a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a>
																													defying: Ruth Craven, who would almost have
																													given her life to keep her back from this;
																													Miss Ravenscroft, the head-mistress, to
																													whom Kathleen's heart did not go out; her
																													own father; her own aunt; Alice Tennant—oh,
																													bother Alice Tennant! And last, Mrs.
																													Hopkins.
																												</p>

																												<p>"Quite an army of them," thought
																													Kathleen. "I have dared to do what none of
																													them approved of, and I am not a bit the
																													worse for it. Darling dad, your own
																													Kathleen will tell you everything, and you
																													may give me what punishment you think best
																													when the fun is over. But now I am having a
																													jolly time."</p>

																												<p>So Kathleen did enjoy herself, and
																													made so many saucy remarks between the
																													acts, and looked so radiant notwithstanding
																													her very plain dress, that several people
																													looked at the beautiful girl and commented
																													about her and her companions.</p>

																												<p>"A school party, my dear," said a
																													lady to her husband.</p>

																												<p>"But I don't see the chaperone," he
																													remarked.</p>

																												<p>And then the lady, who looked again
																													more carefully, could not help observing
																													that these seven girls were certainly not
																													chaperoned by any one. A little wonder and
																													a little uneasiness came into her heart.
																													She was a very kind woman herself; she was
																													a motherly woman, too, and she thought of
																													her own girls tucked up safely in bed at
																													home, and wondered what she would feel if
																													they were alone at a London theater at this
																													hour. Presently something impelled her to
																													bend forward and touch Kathleen on her arm.
																													Kathleen gave a little start and faced her.</p>

																												<p>"Forgive me," she said; "I see that
																													you and your companions are schoolgirls,
																													are you not?"</p>

																												<p>
																													To some people Kathleen might have
																													answered, "That is our own affair, not
																													yours;" but to this lady with the cour
																													<!-- Page 306 -->
																													<a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>teous
																													face and the gentle voice she replied in
																													quite a humble tone:
																												</p>

																												<p>"Yes, madam, we are schoolgirls."</p>

																												<p>"And if you will forgive me, dear,
																													have you no lady looking after you?"</p>

																												<p>"No," said Kate Rourke, bending
																													forward at that moment; "we are out for a
																													spree all by our lone selves."</p>

																												<p>Kate gave a loud laugh as she spoke.
																													The lady started back, and could not help
																													contrasting Kathleen's face with those of
																													the other girls. She bent towards her
																													husband and whispered in his ear. The
																													result of this communication was that, the
																													curtain having fallen for the last time,
																													the actors having left the stage, the play
																													being completely over, and the seven girls
																													being about to get back to Charing Cross as
																													best they could, the lady touched Kathleen
																													on her arm.</p>

																												<p>"You will forgive me, dear," she
																													said; "I am a mother and have daughters of
																													my own. I should not like to see girls in
																													the position you are in without offering to
																													help them."</p>

																												<p>"But what do you mean?" said
																													Kathleen.</p>

																												<p>"I mean this, my dear, that my
																													husband and I will see you seven back to
																													your home, wherever it is."</p>

																												<p>Kathleen burst out laughing; then she
																													looked very grave, and her eyes filled with
																													tears as she said:</p>

																												<p>"But wouldn't mother approve of it?"</p>

																												<p>"If your mother is the least like me
																													she would not approve of it; she would be
																													horrified."</p>

																												<p>"I don't think the lady can see us
																													home," here remarked Clara Sawyer, "for we
																													live at Merrifield, a good long way from
																													London."</p>

																												<p>
																													Again the lady and her husband had a talk
																													together, and then she suggested that they
																													should take the girls
																													<!-- Page 307 -->
																													<a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a> back
																													with them to Charing Cross and put them
																													into their train.
																												</p>

																												<p>"But we thought we'd have a bit of
																													supper," said Kate Rourke.</p>

																												<p>"I can get you some things at the
																													railway station; you ought not to wait for
																													supper in town," said the gentleman in a
																													stern voice.</p>

																												<p>Then somehow all the girls felt
																													ashamed of themselves, Kathleen slightly
																													more ashamed than the others. They left the
																													theater very slowly, with all the
																													lightsomeness and gladness of heart gone.</p>

																												<p>Two cabs were secured for the little
																													party, and with their kind protectors they
																													were taken back to Charing Cross.
																													Eventually they got seats in a comfortable
																													carriage, and found themselves going back
																													again to Merrifield.</p>

																												<p>"Well, it has been a dull sort of
																													thing altogether," said Clara Sawyer. "What
																													meddlesome people!"</p>

																												<p>"Don't!" said Kathleen.</p>

																												<p>"Don't what, Kathleen O'Hara? Why
																													should you speak to me in that reproving
																													voice?"</p>

																												<p>"It isn't that; only they were like
																													two angels. I know it; I am sure of it. We
																													did an awful thing coming to town; I know
																													we did, and I feel—oh, detestable!"</p>

																												<p>
																													Kathleen bent her head forward, covered it
																													with her hands, and sat still. No tears
																													shook her little frame, but there was a
																													storm within. To her dying day Kathleen
																													never forgot that return journey. Truly the
																													fun was all over; the dregs of the cup of
																													pleasure were in their mouths, and there
																													was a fear, great, certain, and very
																													terrible, in their hearts. But with all her
																													fears—and they were many—Kathleen thought
																													again and again of the lady who had girls
																													of her own, and of the gentleman who was
																													both stern and chivalrous, who had the
																													manners of a prince and the
																													<!-- Page 308 -->
																													<a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a> look
																													of a gentleman. As long as she lived she
																													remembered those two faces, and the words
																													of the lady, and the smile with which she
																													said good-bye. She never learned their
																													names; perhaps she did not want to.

																													<h3>THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE LEDGER.</h3>


																													<p>Ruth got up rather earlier than
																														usual on that Saturday morning. She had a
																														dull, stunned kind of feeling round her
																														heart. She was glad of that; she was glad
																														that she was not acutely sorry, or acutely
																														glad, or acutely anxious about anything.</p>

																													<p>"If I could always be like this,
																														nothing would matter," she said to
																														herself.</p>

																													<p>She dressed with her usual
																														scrupulous neatness, and after hesitating
																														for a moment, put on her best Sunday serge
																														dress. It was a dark-blue serge, very
																														neatly made. She combed back her luxurious
																														hair and tied it with a ribbon to match
																														the dress. She then ran downstairs.</p>

																													<p>"Why, Ruth?" said her grandmother,
																														who was pouring some porridge into bowls,
																														"what are you wearing that frock for?"</p>

																													<p>"I thought I would like to, granny."</p>

																													<p>"Well, to be sure. I trust to
																														goodness you are not getting extravagant.
																														It will be doomsday before we can get you
																														another like it. You must remember that I
																														saved up for it sixpence by sixpence, and
																														it took me all my time and my best
																														endeavors to get it."</p>

																													<p>
																														"I know it, granny; and when I wear it I
																														feel that you were very kind to give it
																														me. A girl who wears a dress
																														<!-- Page 309 -->
																														<a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a> like
																														this ought to be very, very good, oughtn't
																														she, granny?"
																													</p>

																													<p>"Well, to be sure, little woman; and
																														so you are. There never was a better
																														child. Sit down now and sup your porridge.
																														It is extra good this morning, and there's
																														a drop of cream in that jug which will
																														give it a flavor."</p>

																													<p>Ruth sat down to the table and drew
																														her bowl of porridge towards her. The
																														warm, nourishing food seemed to choke her;
																														but, all the same, she ate it with
																														resolution."</p>

																													<p>"That's right, dear," said her
																														grandmother. "'It's putting a bit of color
																														into your cheeks. You are too white
																														altogether, Ruth. I hope, my dear, you are
																														not working too hard."</p>

																													<p>"Oh, that's all right," said Ruth,
																														keeping back a groan.</p>

																													<p>"It's a fine thing your getting into
																														that school," continued Mrs. Craven; "it
																														gives you a chance. Do you know, now, when
																														I look at you and see the pretty little
																														girl you are turning into, and observe
																														your lady-like ways, which every one
																														remarks on, I think of the time when your
																														father was your age."</p>

																													<p>"Yes, granny," said Ruth,
																														brightening up and looking earnestly at
																														the old lady; "you never care to talk
																														about father, but I should greatly like to
																														hear about him this morning."</p>

																													<p>
																														"Well, child, I don't talk of him because
																														it hurts me too much. He was the only
																														child I ever had, and if I live to be a
																														hundred I sha'n't get over his death. But
																														he was like you—very neat in his person,
																														and very particular, and always keen over
																														his books. And do you know what he said to
																														his father? It was when he was fifteen
																														years old, just for all the world about
																														the age you are now. I mind the time as
																														well as if it was yesterday. Her father
																														and I were sitting by the hearth, and the
																														boy came and stood near us. Your
																														grandfather looked up at him, and his
																														<!-- Page 310 -->
																														<a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a> blue
																														eyes seemed to melt with love and pride,
																														and he said:
																													</p>

																													<p>"'What will you be, my boy? Will you
																														let me teach you the business, and save up
																														all the money I can for you to sell
																														groceries on a bigger scale? There's many
																														a small business like mine which, when
																														built up, means a great big business and
																														much wealth. If you have a turn that way I
																														could set you on your legs; I am certain
																														of it. I'd like to do it. Would you like
																														that best, or would you rather have a
																														profession and be made a gentleman?'</p>

																													<p>"'The gentleman part doesn't
																														matter,' said our boy in reply to that;
																														'but I think, father, if you can give me
																														my choice, I'd like best to be that which,
																														if necessary, would oblige me to give my
																														life,'</p>

																													<p>"'What do you mean?' asked his
																														father, and the lad explained with his
																														eyes shining.</p>

																													<p>"'I have only got one life,' he
																														said, 'and I'd like to give it if
																														necessary.'"</p>

																													<p>"To tell the truth, Ruth, I could
																														not understand him."</p>

																													<p>"But I can," said Ruth. She hastily
																														put down her porridge spoon and jumped to
																														her feet. "I can understand," she
																														continued; "and I am proud of him."</p>

																													<p>"So he went into the army. I wish
																														you could have seen him in his uniform;
																														and his father paid for every scrap of the
																														whole thing, and educated him and all. Oh,
																														dear! it was a proud moment. But we
																														weren't proud afterwards when we heard
																														that he was killed. His father reminded me
																														of his words: 'I'd like to be that for
																														which I could give my life if necessary,'"</p>

																													<p>There was quite a pink color in each
																														of Ruth's cheeks now, and her eyes were
																														very bright.</p>

																													<p>"I will go and see grandfather," she
																														said, "and then I must be off to school."</p>

																													<p>
																														<!-- Page 311 -->
																														<a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>She
																														left the kitchen and went into the tiny
																														parlor where the old man was seated. It
																														was his fashion to get up early and go
																														straight to the parlor and read or talk
																														softly to himself. For a couple of months
																														now he had never sat in the kitchen; he
																														said it caused a buzzing in his head. Mrs.
																														Craven brought him his meals into the
																														little parlor. He had finished his
																														breakfast when Ruth, in her neat Sunday
																														dress, entered the room. There was an
																														exalted feeling in her heart, caused by
																														the narrative which her grandmother had
																														told her of her father.
																													</p>

																													<p>"Well, little woman," said the old
																														man, "and you are off to school? Or is it
																														school? Perhaps it is Sunday morning and
																														you are off to church."</p>

																													<p>"No, grandfather; it is Saturday
																														morning—quite a different thing."</p>

																													<p>"Well, my love, I am as pleased as
																														Punch about that school. I can't tell you
																														how I think about it, and love to feel
																														that my own little lass is doing so well
																														there. And if you get the scholarship,
																														why, we will be made; we won't have
																														another care nor anxiety; we won't have
																														another wrinkle of trouble as long as we
																														remain in the world."</p>

																													<p>Ruth went straight over to the old
																														man, knelt down by his side, and looked
																														into his face.</p>

																													<p>"Stroke my hair, granddad," she
																														said.</p>

																													<p>He raised his trembling hand and
																														placed it on her head.</p>

																													<p>"That is nice," she said, and caught
																														his hand as it went backwards and forwards
																														over her silky black hair, and kissed it.</p>

																													<p>"Granddad," she said after a pause,
																														"is it the best thing—quite the best
																														thing—always to come out on the right side
																														of the ledger?"</p>

																													<p>
																														"Eh? Listen to the little woman," said the
																														old man,
																														<!-- Page 312 -->
																														<a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a> much
																														pleased and interested by her words. "Why,
																														of course, Ruth; it is the only thing."
																													</p>

																													<p>"But does it mean sometimes,
																														grandfather—dishonor?"</p>

																													<p>"No, it never means that," said Mr.
																														Craven gravely and thoughtfully. "But I
																														will tell you what, Ruthie. It does mean
																														sometimes all you have got."</p>

																													<p>"Yes," said Ruth, "I understand."
																														She rose to her feet. Do you think my
																														father would have come out on the right
																														side of the ledger?"</p>

																													<p>"Ah, child! when he lay dead on the
																														field of battle he came very much out on
																														the right side, to my thinking. But why
																														that melancholy note in your voice, Ruth?
																														And why are your cheeks so flushed? Is
																														anything the matter?"</p>

																													<p>"Kiss me," said Ruth. "I am glad you
																														have said what you did about father. I am
																														more glad than sorry, on the whole, this
																														morning. Good-bye, grandfather."</p>

																													<p>She kissed him; then she raised her
																														flower-like head and walked out of the
																														room with a gentle dignity all her own.</p>

																													<p>"What has come to the little woman?"
																														thought the old man.</p>

																													<p>But in a minute or two he forgot
																														her, and called to his wife to bring him
																														the account-books.</p>

																													<p>"Why do you bother yourself about
																														them?" she asked.</p>

																													<p>"It has come over me," he replied,
																														"that I have counted things wrong, and
																														that I'll come out on the right side if I
																														am a bit more careful. Put the books on
																														this little table, and leave me for an
																														hour or two. That's right, old woman."</p>

																													<p>"Very well, old man," she replied,
																														and she pushed the table towards him, put
																														the account-books thereon, and left the
																														room.</p>

																													<p>
																														Meanwhile Ruth went slowly to school. She
																														was in
																														<!-- Page 313 -->
																														<a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a> good
																														time. There was no need to hurry. The
																														morning was fresh and beautiful; there was
																														a gentle breeze which fanned her face. It
																														seemed to her that if she let her soul go
																														it would mount on that breeze and get up
																														high above the clouds and the temptations
																														of earth.
																													</p>

																													<p>"I am glad," she said to herself,
																														"the right side of the ledger means giving
																														up all, and the best of life is to be able
																														to lose it if necessary. I will cling to
																														these two thoughts, and I don't believe if
																														the worst comes that anything can really
																														hurt me."</p>

																													<p>When she got near the school she was
																														met by Mrs. Hopkins. She was amazed to see
																														that good woman, as at that hour she was
																														usually busily engaged in her shop. But
																														Mrs. Hopkins took the bull by the horns
																														and said quietly:</p>

																													<p>"I came out on purpose to see you,
																														Ruth Craven."</p>

																													<p>"Well, and what do you want?" asked
																														Ruth.</p>

																													<p>"My dear, you are not looking too
																														well."</p>

																													<p>"Please do not mind my looks."</p>

																													<p>"It is just this, dear. There will
																														be no end of a fuss in the school to-day."</p>

																													<p>Ruth did not reply.</p>

																													<p>"And they will press you hard."</p>

																													<p>Still Ruth made no answer.</p>

																													<p>"You know what it will mean if you
																														tell?"</p>

																													<p>Ruth's grave eyes were fixed on Mrs.
																														Hopkins's face.</p>

																													<p>
																														"Child, I don't want to doubt you—nobody
																														who knows you could do that—but it will
																														mean ruin to poor Susy and to many and
																														many a girl at the Great Shirley School.
																														It isn't so much Miss O'Hara we mean. Miss
																														O'Hara has gone into this with her eyes
																														open; and she is rich, and what is
																														disgrace to her in this little part of
																														England, when she herself lives in a great
																														big castle in Ireland, and is a queen,
																														lady, and all the rest? But it means—oh,
																														such a
																														<!-- Page 314 -->
																														<a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a>
																														frightful lot to so many! Now, Susy, for
																														instance. I meant to apprentice her to a
																														good trade when she had gone through her
																														course of work at the Great Shirley; but
																														she will have to be a servant—a little
																														maid-of-all-work—and I think that it would
																														break my heart if she was expelled."
																													</p>

																													<p>"And what do you want me to do, Mrs.
																														Hopkins?"</p>

																													<p>"Oh, my dear, not to think of
																														yourself, but of the many who will be
																														ruined—not to tell, Ruth Craven."</p>

																													<p>Ruth gave a gentle smile; then she
																														put out her small slim hand and touched
																														Mrs. Hopkins, and then turned and
																														continued her walk to the school.</p>

																													<p>There were a group of foundationers
																														standing round the entrance. Ruth longed
																														to avoid them, but they saw her and
																														clustered round her, and each and all
																														began to whisper in her ears:</p>

																													<p>"You will be faithful, Ruth; nothing
																														will induce you to tell. It will be hard
																														on you, but you won't ruin so many of us.
																														It is better for one to suffer than for
																														all to suffer. You won't tell, will you,
																														Ruth?"</p>

																													<p>Ruth made no reply in words. The
																														great bell rang, the doors of the school
																														were flung wide, and the girls, Ruth
																														amongst them, entered.</p>

																														<h3>AFTER THE FUN COMES THE DELUGE</h3>


																														<p>
																															Kathleen O'Hara's nature was of the kind
																															that rises to the top of the mountains
																															and sinks again to the lowest vales. She
																															had been on the tip-top of the hills of
																															her own fantasy all that evening. When
																															she ran quickly home
																															<!-- Page 315 -->
																															<a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>
																															under the stars she began to realize what
																															she had done She had done something of
																															which her mother would have been ashamed.
																															Not for a moment had Kathleen thought of
																															this way of looking at her escapade until
																															she read the truth in the eyes of the
																															unknown but most kind lady. She despised
																															herself for her own action, but she did
																															not dread discovery. It did not occur to
																															her as possible that what she and her
																															companions had done could be known. If no
																															one knew, no one need be at all more
																															sorry or at all more unhappy on account
																															of her action.
																														</p>

																														<p>"Poor Wild Irish Girls! they are
																															getting into hot water," she said to
																															herself. "But this little bit of fun need
																															never be told to any one."</p>

																														<p>Kathleen had let herself out of the
																															house by the strong rope of ivy; she
																															meant to return to her bedroom the same
																															way. Alice was a very sound sleeper; it
																															did not occur to her that Alice on that
																															particular night might be awake. She
																															reached the foot of the window in perfect
																															safety, saw that the ivy looked precisely
																															as it had looked when she climbed down
																															it, and began her upward ascent. This was
																															decidedly more difficult than her
																															downward one; but she was light of foot
																															and agile. Had she not climbed dangerous
																															crags after young eaglets at home?
																															By-and-by she reached the window-sill.
																															How nice! the window was partly open. She
																															pushed it wider and got in. The room was
																															in darkness. So much the better. She
																															stepped softly, reached her own bed,
																															undressed, and lay down. How nice of
																															Alice to be sound asleep! Then of course
																															it was not Alice she saw standing on the
																															platform looking at her with reproachful,
																															horrified eyes.</p>

																														<p>"I must have dreamt it," thought
																															Kathleen. "Now all is well, and I shall
																															sleep like a top until the morning."</p>

																														<p>
																															This, however, was no easy feat. Alice's
																															quiet breathing
																															<!-- Page 316 -->
																															<a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>
																															sounded not many feet away, and after a
																															time it seemed to get on Kathleen's
																															nerves. She moved restlessly in her bed.
																															Alice awoke, and complained of the cold.
																														</p>

																														<p>"The window is a little open," said
																															Kathleen. "Shall I shut it?"</p>

																														<p>Alice made no answer. Kathleen
																															jumped up, shut the window, and fastened
																															it. She then got back into bed. In the
																															morning Alice called out to her:</p>

																														<p>"Is your headache better?"</p>

																														<p>"Had I one?" began Kathleen. Then
																															she blushed; then she laughed; then she
																															said, "Oh, it's quite well."</p>

																														<p>Alice gazed steadily at her. It
																															seemed to Kathleen that Alice's eyes were
																															full of something very terrible.</p>

																														<p>"Are you coming to school to-day?"
																															asked Alice the next moment.</p>

																														<p>"Of course. Why do you ask such a
																															strange question?"</p>

																														<p>"I shouldn't think you would wish
																															to; but there is no accounting for what
																															some people can live through."</p>

																														<p>"Alice, what do you mean?"</p>

																														<p>"What I say."</p>

																														<p>"Explain yourself."</p>

																														<p>"No."</p>

																														<p>"Is there anything very awful going
																															to happen at school?"</p>

																														<p>"You will find out for yourself
																															when you get there."</p>

																														<p>"Dear me!" said Kathleen; "you look
																															as if the deluge was coming."</p>

																														<p>"And so it is," said Alice.</p>

																														<p>
																															She had finished dressing by now, and she
																															went out of the room. The two girls went
																															down to breakfast. Alice's face was still
																															full of an awful suppressed knowledge,
																															which she would not let out to any one;
																															but Mrs. Tennant was smiling and looking
																															just as usual, and the boys were
																															<!-- Page 317 -->
																															<a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a> as
																															fond of Kathleen as was their wont. She
																															had completely won their immature
																															masculine hearts, and they invariably sat
																															one on each side of her at meals, helped
																															her to the best the table contained, and
																															fussed over her in a way that pleased her
																															young majesty. Kathleen was very glad
																															that morning to get the boys' attention.
																															She determined to sit with her back
																															slightly turned to Alice, in order not to
																															look into her face. They were about
																															half-way through breakfast when there
																															came a ring at the front-door, and
																															Cassandra Weldon's voice was heard.
																														</p>

																														<p>Alice went out to her. The two
																															girls kept whispering together in the
																															passage. Presently Alice returned to the
																															breakfast-room, and Kathleen now noticed
																															that her eyes were red, as though she had
																															just been indulging in a bout of crying.</p>

																														<p>"What can be the matter?" she
																															thought.</p>

																														<p>"Why, my dear Alice," said her
																															mother, looking up at this moment, "what
																															did Cassandra want? And what is the
																															matter with you? Have you had bad news?"</p>

																														<p>"Yes, mother," answered Alice.</p>

																														<p>"But what is it, dear?"</p>

																														<p>"You will know soon enough,
																															mother."</p>

																														<p>"That is exactly what you said to
																															me upstairs," said Kathleen, driven
																															desperate by Alice's manner. "I do wish
																															you would speak out.—Do get her to speak
																															out, Mrs. Tennant. She hints at something
																															awful going to happen at school to-day. I
																															declare I won't go if it is as bad as
																															that."</p>

																														<p>"It would be like you not to come,"
																															said Alice. "But I think you will come. I
																															don't think you will be allowed to be
																															absent."</p>

																														<p>"Allowed!" said Kathleen. "Who is
																															going to prevent me staying away from
																															school if I wish to?"</p>

																														<p>
																															<!-- Page 318 -->
																															<a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a>"The
																															vote of the majority," said Alice very
																															firmly. "Now, look here, Kathleen; don't
																															make a fuss. It is wrong for the girls of
																															the Great Shirley School to absent
																															themselves without due reason."
																														</p>

																														<p>"Well, I have a headache. I had one
																															last night."</p>

																														<p>"No, you had not."</p>

																														<p>"Alice, dear, why do you speak to
																															Kathleen like that?" said her mother.
																															"What is the matter with you?—Kathleen,
																															do keep your temper.—Alice, I am sorry
																															something has annoyed you so much."</p>

																														<p>"It is past speaking about, mother.
																															You will understand all too
																															soon.—Kathleen, it is time for us to be
																															going."</p>

																														<p>"I am not going," said Kathleen,
																															"so there!"</p>

																														<p>"Kathleen, you are."</p>

																														<p>"No."</p>

																														<p>"Come, Kathleen; come."</p>

																														<p>"You needn't fuss about me; I am
																															not coming."</p>

																														<p>"Kathleen, dear, I think you ought
																															to go. Go for my sake," said Mrs.
																															Tennant.</p>

																														<p>Kathleen looked up then, saw the
																															anxiety in Mrs. Tennant's face, and her
																															heart relented. She was in reality not at
																															all afraid of what might be going to
																															happen at school. If there was to be a
																															fray, she desired nothing better than to
																															be in the midst of it.</p>

																														<p>
																															"All right," she said, "I will go; but I
																															won't go yet. I am going to be late this
																															morning. I can see by your manner, Alice,
																															that I have got into disgrace. Now, I
																															can't think what disgrace I have got
																															into, unless some horrid girls have been
																															prying and telling tales out of school.
																															That sort of thing I should think even
																															the Great Shirley girls would not
																															attempt. Unless some one has been mean
																															enough to act in that way, there is
																															nothing in the world to prevent my going
																															to school, and taking my accustomed
																															place, and
																															<!-- Page 319 -->
																															<a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>
																															disporting myself in my usual manner. I
																															shall get a bad mark for being late; that
																															is the worst that can happen to me. I am
																															going to be very late, so you can go on
																															by yourself, Alice."
																														</p>

																														<p>Alice very nearly stamped her foot.
																															She went so far as to beg and implore of
																															Kathleen, but Kathleen was imperturbable.</p>

																														<p>"You are very naughty, Kathleen,"
																															said Mrs. Tennant, but Kathleen ran up to
																															her and kissed her.</p>

																														<p>"You and I will have some fun,
																															perhaps, this afternoon," she said. "I
																															have got a lot of new plans in my head;
																															they are all about you, and to make you
																															happy and not so tired. Don't be cross
																															with me. I'll promise that I will never
																															be naughty again after to-day."</p>

																														<p>Mrs. Tennant said nothing more. A
																															minute or two later Alice left the house.</p>

																														<p>It was quite an hour after Alice
																															had departed that Kathleen took it into
																															her head that she might as well stroll
																															towards the school. On Saturdays school
																															was over a little earlier than other
																															days. There was a special class which she
																															was anxious not to miss, for in spite of
																															herself she was becoming interested in
																															certain portions of her lessons. Her
																															depression had now left her, and she felt
																															excited, but at the same time irritated.
																															A spirit of defiance came over her. She
																															went upstairs and selected from her
																															heterogeneous wardrobe one of her very
																															prettiest and most fashionable and most
																															unsuitable dresses. She put on a hat
																															trimmed with flowers and feathers, and a
																															sash of many colors round her waist. Over
																															all she slipped her dark-blue velvet
																															jacket, and with rich sables round her
																															neck and wrists, she ran downstairs.</p>

																														<p>"Why, Kathleen, any one would
																															suppose you were going to a concert,"
																															said Mrs. Tennant.</p>

																														<p>
																															<!-- Page 320 -->
																															<a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a>"Ah,
																															my dear good friend, I like to look jolly
																															once in a way. I am certain to get a bad
																															mark for unpunctuality, so I may as well
																															get it looking my best as my worst. You
																															don't blame me for that, do you?"
																														</p>

																														<p>"No. Go off now, dear, and don't
																															let me find you so troublesome again."</p>

																														<p>Kathleen started off. She ran
																															across the common, and reached the doors
																															of the great school exactly one hour
																															after she ought to have arrived. To her
																															amazement, she saw quite a crowd of
																															people waiting outside, and amongst them
																															was Mrs. Hopkins. There were several
																															other mothers as well, and when they saw
																															Kathleen they turned their backs on her,
																															and one or two were heard to say aloud:</p>

																														<p>"It's she who has done it."</p>

																														<p>But Mrs. Hopkins did not turn her
																															back on Kathleen; she came close to her,
																															and even took her hand.</p>

																														<p>"Why are you late, miss?" she said.
																															"But perhaps it is best. Miss O'Hara, you
																															won't forget my poor aunt; you will be
																															sure to get her the little almshouse in
																															Ireland?"</p>

																														<p>"Yes, of course I will," said
																															Kathleen. "Aunt Katie has written about
																															it already, and I will write to-night.
																															You may tell Mrs. Church that it is
																															absolutely quite certain that she will
																															get it. What is the matter, Mrs. Hopkins?
																															How strange you look! And all those other
																															women—they seem quite cross with me. What
																															have I done?"</p>

																														<p>"Ah, miss! I keep saying to them
																															that it is because you are Irish and
																															don't know frolic from serious mischief.
																															Bless your heart, miss! it is you that
																															are kind. You mean kindly—no one more
																															so—and so I have said to them."</p>

																														<p>"But it will be a nice thing if my
																															girl gets expelled owing to her," said a
																															sour-faced woman, coming forward now and
																															placing her arms akimbo just in front of
																															Kathleen.</p>

																														<p>
																															"Is it that that every one is thinking
																															about?" said Kath
																															<!-- Page 321 -->
																															<a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>leen.
																															She stood still for a minute. The color
																															left her face. She felt a wave of
																															tempestuous blood pressing against her
																															heart; then it all rushed back in a fiery
																															color into her cheeks and in brightness
																															to her eyes.
																														</p>

																														<p>"And Alice knew of this," she said
																															to herself; "and when I didn't come to
																															school this morning she thought that I
																															was afraid. Afraid!—Don't keep me, good
																															people," said Kathleen. "Make way,
																															please. I am sorry I am a little late."</p>

																														<p>She walked past them all. When she
																															got as far as the school door she turned
																															to Mrs. Hopkins.</p>

																														<p>"You can tell your aunt that the
																															almshouse is safe," she said, and then
																															she blew a kiss to her and disappeared
																															into the school.</p>

																															<h3>WHO WAS THE RINGLEADER?</h3>


																															<p>In the passage a monitress was
																																standing, and when she saw Kathleen she
																																came up to her and said in an agitated
																																tone:</p>

																															<p>"They are all assembled in the
																																great hall. Go in quickly; you may be in
																																time, after all."</p>

																															<p>The voice of the monitress quite
																																shook, and there was a troubled, very
																																nearly tearful expression in her eyes.</p>

																															<p>"But why is the whole school in
																																the central hall?" asked Kathleen. "Why
																																are they not in their different
																																classrooms?"</p>

																															<p>"Go in—go in," said the monitress.
																																"You will know when you find yourself
																																there; and there is not a moment to
																																lose."</p>

																															<p>
																																<!-- Page 322 -->
																																<a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a>So
																																Kathleen, impelled by a curious power
																																which seemed to drive her whether she
																																will it or not, opened the door of the
																																great central hall and entered. She
																																found it quite full. The four hundred
																																girls who composed the Great Shirley
																																School were all present; so were the
																																teachers, and so were the professors who
																																came to give them music and drawing and
																																literature lessons. So was the
																																head-mistress, Miss Ravenscroft; and
																																also, seated on the same little raised
																																platform, were the six ladies who formed
																																the governors. The governors sat in a
																																little circle, Miss Mackenzie in the
																																middle. Miss Mackenzie looked hard and
																																very firm. Her iron-gray hair, her false
																																teeth, her prominent nose, and her
																																rather cruel steel-gray eyes made
																																themselves felt all down the long room.
																																The other ladies also looked as they
																																usually did, except that Mrs. Naylor had
																																traces of tears in her eyes, and bent
																																forward several times to whisper
																																something to Miss Mackenzie, who
																																invariably shook her head and looked
																																more stern than ever. There was
																																evidently a moment's pause, and the
																																whole school was in a waiting attitude
																																when Kathleen made her appearance. All
																																eyes were then turned in her direction;
																																all eyes fixed themselves on the showily
																																dressed and very handsome child who
																																suddenly entered the room.
																															</p>

																															<p>
																																"It is Kathleen O'Hara;" "It is Kathleen
																																O'Hara herself;" "Well, she has come at
																																last;" "Yes, it is Kathleen O'Hara,"
																																passed from lip to lip, until Kathleen
																																felt that her name had got round her and
																																above her and to right and left of her.
																																She had an instant's sensation of
																																absolute fear. She had a flashing desire
																																to turn tail and run out of the room;
																																but the same power which had pushed her
																																into the room now sent her right up the
																																long central hall past all the watching,
																																expectant, eager-looking girls. Outside
																																some one had said that she would be
																																afraid. No, what
																																<!-- Page 323 -->
																																<a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a>ever
																																the danger, she knew she could keep her
																																own. She was not Kathleen O'Hara of
																																Carrigrohane Castle for nothing.
																															</p>

																															<p>"Come here, Miss O'Hara," said the
																																voice of Miss Ravenscroft at that
																																moment.</p>

																															<p>Kathleen obeyed at once. She found
																																a seat on the front bench, dropped into
																																it, and at the same moment encountered
																																the almost malicious glance of Alice
																																Tennant. She turned away from Alice.
																																That look seemed suddenly to steady her
																																nerves. She was afraid just for a moment
																																that she might give way to something,
																																she knew not what, but Alice's look
																																hardened her heart. Time had been given
																																Kathleen to take her place, to recover
																																any emotion she might have felt by her
																																sudden entrance, and then Miss
																																Ravenscroft rose to her feet.</p>

																															<p>"It is my painful duty," she said,
																																"to have to say something which
																																distresses me far more than I can give
																																you any idea of. My dear girls, you have
																																all been summoned to attend in this hall
																																to-day in order to meet the governors of
																																the school, Miss Mackenzie, Mrs. Naylor,
																																Mrs. Ross, the Misses Scott, and Miss
																																Jane Smyth. These ladies have come to
																																meet you, because they wish thoroughly
																																to investigate a most disgraceful matter
																																which has lately been going on in the
																																school."</p>

																															<p>Miss Ravenscroft paused and looked
																																round her.</p>

																															<p>
																																"I allude," she said, "to the
																																insurrection in our midst—a sort of
																																civil war in our camp. There are, I am
																																given to understand, in the midst of
																																this hitherto well conducted and
																																admirable school, a number of girls who
																																have banded themselves together in
																																disregard of its laws, and who have made
																																for themselves laws contrary to the
																																peace-abiding principles of this great
																																school and noble institution: who meet
																																at unseemly hours, who preach rebellion
																																each to the
																																<!-- Page 324 -->
																																<a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a>
																																other, who dare to publicly break the
																																laws of the school, and who defy the
																																express wishes of myself as
																																head-mistress and the governors of the
																																school by insisting on continuing their
																																wicked meetings. And last night a
																																certain number of these girls actually
																																took it upon themselves to go to
																																London—to do what, I can't say—and to
																																return at midnight, alone and
																																unchaperoned. Such conduct is so
																																unworthy, so undignified, and so
																																absolutely sinful that there is only one
																																course to pursue. The girls who are
																																rebellious in the school must be
																																exposed; their conduct must be
																																investigated, and a very heavy
																																punishment awarded to them."
																															</p>

																															<p>Here Miss Ravenscroft looked round
																																her. She caught the eye of Miss
																																Mackenzie, who beckoned to her and
																																whispered something in her ear.</p>

																															<p>"Miss Mackenzie bids me say that
																																if the girls who belong to this society
																																will at this moment give up the name of
																																their ringleader they themselves will be
																																forgiven. What punishment they receive
																																will only be connected with their work
																																in the school, and may possibly exclude
																																them from competing for certain
																																scholarships during this present term,
																																but for the rest nothing further will be
																																said. But it is essential that the name
																																of the ringleader, as well as her rules
																																and her motives, should be declared."</p>

																															<p>Miss Ravenscroft paused again and
																																looked down the whole length of the long
																																hall. She looked to right and left.</p>

																															<p>
																																"Don't let any girl think," she said
																																after a pause, "that she is acting nobly
																																by suppressing information which is for
																																the benefit of the school. I do not ask
																																the girls who are spoken of as the
																																paying girls to expose their companions,
																																nor do I ask those foundationers who
																																have not joined the band of insurgents
																																to betray their fellows; but what I do
																																ask is this: that the girls
																																themselves—the rebels—
																																<!-- Page 325 -->
																																<a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a>should
																																rise in a body and point to their
																																leader. With that leader the governors
																																will deal. The girls themselves will
																																have forgiveness."
																															</p>

																															<p>Miss Ravenscroft again paused. The
																																silence which followed might be felt.
																																Susy Hopkins bent her head and sobbed.
																																Janey Ford trembled all over, and
																																clutched tightly the hand of her
																																companion. But no one spoke. It was at
																																that moment that Kathleen calmly and
																																slowly raised her face and looked around
																																her. She looked back, and caught the
																																eyes of at least a dozen of those
																																foundationers whom she had pitied and
																																helped and been jolly with. She looked
																																to the right then, and met as many more
																																faces of girls whom she knew, and who
																																were members of the Wild Irish Girls'
																																Society. Then very calmly she resumed
																																her nonchalant attitude in the front row
																																of the schoolgirls. Miss Ravenscroft
																																meanwhile stood waiting. Still no one
																																spoke.</p>

																															<p>"Will no one speak?" she said.
																																"Will no girl present be brave enough to
																																save the school?"</p>

																															<p>Still there was silence.</p>

																															<p>
																																"This is a very good and a great
																																school," said Miss Ravenscroft. "It
																																gives for a very trifling sum an
																																education worthy of the very best and
																																most expensive schools in England. It
																																was founded some hundred years ago, by
																																those who thought much and in advance of
																																their time. In an age when girls were
																																almost uneducated, when nothing further
																																was required from them than a smattering
																																of reading and writing, these wise and
																																far-seeing people said that they would
																																give the girls of the future a chance.
																																So they left money for the purpose, and
																																that money, wisely invested, has borne
																																fruit. The great school was built, and
																																has for generations helped many girls
																																who otherwise might not have been able
																																to earn their own bread. Even for the
																																paying girls the expense for all they
																																receive is but a trifle. But
																																<!-- Page 326 -->
																																<a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a>
																																the school does more than that. It was
																																the wish of the founders that there
																																should always be one hundred
																																foundationers on the school lists, and
																																these girls are admitted free; they pay
																																nothing in hard cash for what they
																																receive. They are taught liberally; they
																																have the best rooms, the best
																																laboratories; the best music, the best
																																art, are supplied to them. If they have
																																talent they have every chance of
																																bringing it to the fore, for the
																																education is thorough and generous. But
																																the school does even more than this. It
																																opens up scholarships—many
																																scholarships—of great value for those
																																special girls who call themselves
																																foundationers. Now my dear girls of the
																																Great Shirley School, you must clearly
																																understand that no establishment of this
																																kind can be worked except on certain
																																lines, and these lines mean order,
																																method, and obedience. Rules must be
																																made, and these rules at any cost must
																																be obeyed. These rules are made not only
																																to enable the girls to get the best
																																possible education out of the school,
																																but also that the greater education of
																																mind and heart, which alone can build up
																																a fine and useful character, may not be
																																neglected. That sort of education can
																																only be given by conforming to
																																principles. Now, there are certain
																																principles which every girl who comes
																																into this school is bound to adhere to.
																																She is bound on all occasions to behave
																																with sobriety, with a sense of modesty
																																and true womanly feeling; she is never,
																																if she is a true member of the school,
																																to join herself to rebels who do not
																																believe in its rules. Now, there is not
																																the slightest doubt that the society
																																which you girls—a certain number of
																																you—have joined is rebellious, has bad
																																effects, and has rules of its own which
																																are absolutely contrary to the rules of
																																the Great Shirley School. It is
																																impossible for you to be members of this
																																society and to be members of the Great
																																Shirley School. If, therefore, you do
																																not immedi
																																<!-- Page 327 -->
																																<a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a>ately
																																forsake that society, and immediately
																																promise here and now that you will give
																																it up forever, we shall have the painful
																																duty of expelling you from the school.
																																You have a few minutes in which to
																																decide. Nobody wants to be hard on you;
																																nobody wants to be hard on your founder,
																																although she must no longer take her
																																place as a member of this school; but if
																																you don't confess, very stringent and
																																terrible methods will have to be
																																resorted to."
																															</p>

																															<p>Miss Ravenscroft here resumed her
																																seat. There was a faint applause which
																																came from different parts of the room,
																																but was not unanimous, and soon died
																																away. After that there was silence. Miss
																																Mackenzie bent forward and made some
																																notes in a little black book which she
																																held upon her lap. Mrs. Naylor took her
																																handkerchief and wiped the tears from
																																her eyes; the other governors looked
																																depressed and uneasy. Meanwhile Miss
																																Ravenscroft sat with her eyes fixed on
																																the different girls in their different
																																forms. There was no movement. Kathleen
																																drew herself up proudly.</p>

																															<p>"They're not quite such cads," she
																																said under her breath.</p>

																															<p>But just as the thought came to
																																her, Miss Mackenzie, the woman most
																																respected and most dreaded in the whole
																																of Merrifield, rose slowly to her feet.</p>

																															<p>"Girls of the Great Shirley
																																School," she said, "your head-mistress,
																																Miss Ravenscroft, has conveyed to you a
																																message from me and from the other
																																governors. The message is to the effect
																																that if those silly girls who have
																																allied themselves to that most
																																ridiculous society, the Wild Irish
																																Girls, will give the name of their
																																leader, they shall be forgiven. Do you
																																accept, foundationers, or do you
																																decline?"</p>

																															<p>Dead silence ensued.</p>

																															<p>
																																"I presume," said Miss Mackenzie after a
																																pause of a full
																																<!-- Page 328 -->
																																<a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a>
																																minute, "that your silence means refusal
																																I have therefore to turn to a certain
																																young girl in this school who was a
																																member of the Wild Irish Girls' Society,
																																and who has now left it.—Ruth Craven,
																																have the goodness to step forward."
																															</p>

																															<p>Ruth had been seated in the fourth
																																bench. She rose slowly. Kathleen felt a
																																curious tremor run through her, but she
																																did not move a muscle; only when Ruth
																																appeared at the edge of the platform, it
																																was with the greatest effort she could
																																keep herself from jumping up, taking her
																																hand, and mounting the platform by her
																																side.</p>

																															<p>"Step up here, Miss Craven," said
																																Miss Mackenzie.</p>

																															<p>Ruth did so.</p>

																															<p>"Will you have the goodness to
																																stand just here, Miss Craven?"</p>

																															<p>Ruth went to the place indicated.</p>

																															<p>"You can now face me, and your
																																schoolfellows can also see you.—Girls, I
																																have requested Ruth Craven to take the
																																prominent position she now occupies in
																																order that you may all see her. You all
																																know her, do you not? Those who know
																																Ruth Craven, hold up their hands."</p>

																															<p>Immediately there was a great show
																																of uplifted hands.</p>

																															<p>"I presume that you all like her?"</p>

																															<p>Again the hands went up, and
																																Kathleen's was raised the highest of
																																all. Ruth's little face, however,
																																remained perfectly white and still; only
																																her eyes were dark with emotion. She
																																kept thinking of her father.</p>

																															<p>
																																"I should like that which would make me
																																give <i>my life</i> if necessary," he
																																had said; and her grandfather had said,
																																"Sometimes when you come out on the
																																right side of the ledger it means giving
																																<i>all</i> that you possess."
																															</p>

																															<p>
																																Ruth could scarcely see the faces which
																																rose up like a
																																<!-- Page 329 -->
																																<a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>
																																great ocean beneath her, but she
																																remembered her father's words very
																																distinctly.
																															</p>

																															<p>"You all see Ruth Craven,"
																																continued Miss Mackenzie. "As far as I
																																know, she is a good girl; and I judge by
																																your method of answering my question
																																that she is a popular girl. I know,
																																alas! that she is poor. I have heard a
																																great deal about her intellectual
																																endowments, and believe that this school
																																could be of immense advantage to her. I
																																believe, in short, that she is the
																																typical sort of girl of whom the
																																founders thought when they instituted
																																this great and noble house of learning.
																																Nevertheless, Ruth Craven must fall if
																																necessary for the good of the
																																many.—Ruth, I wish to ask you a certain
																																question. You were a member of that
																																rebellious society, the Wild Irish
																																Girls?"</p>

																															<p>"Yes, Miss Mackenzie."</p>

																															<p>Ruth's "Yes" was very clear; her
																																face looked modest but firm. There was
																																not the slightest hesitation in the
																																words she uttered. Her speech was not
																																loud, but it could be heard to the end
																																of the great hall.</p>

																															<p>"You are no longer a member?"</p>

																															<p>"No."</p>

																															<p>
																																"Three days ago I and the other
																																governors sent for you to ask you
																																certain questions. You refused to answer
																																those questions then. We gave you three
																																days to consider, telling you that if at
																																the end of that time you still kept to
																																your resolution there was only one thing
																																for us to do, and that was to make an
																																example of you in the presence of the
																																entire school—in short, to take from you
																																your right of membership, and to expel
																																you from the school, taking from you all
																																privileges, all chances of acquiring
																																learning and the different valuable
																																scholarships which this school was
																																opening to you. We came to this most
																																painful resolve knowing well that it
																																would cast a blight upon your life, that
																																<!-- Page 330 -->
																																<a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a>
																																wherever you went the knowledge that you
																																had been publicly expelled from the
																																Great Shirley School would follow
																																you—that you would, in short, step down,
																																Ruth Craven. I quite understand from the
																																expression of your face that you are the
																																sort of child who imagines that she is
																																doing right when she keeps back the
																																knowledge which she thinks she ought not
																																to betray; but we governors do not agree
																																with you. There are six of us here, and
																																we wish to tell you that if you now
																																refuse the information which we wish to
																																obtain from you, you will do <i>wrong</i>.
																																You are young, and cannot know as much
																																as we do. We earnestly beg of you,
																																therefore; not to make a martyr of
																																yourself in a silly and ridiculous
																																cause.—Mrs. Naylor, will you now say
																																what you think to Ruth Craven?"
																															</p>

																															<p>"I think, dear child," said Mrs.
																																Naylor, speaking in a tremulous voice,
																																which could scarcely be heard half-way
																																down the room, "that it would be best
																																for you not to conceal the truth."</p>

																															<p>"And I agree," said Mrs. Ross.</p>

																															<p>"We all agree," said the Misses
																																Scott and Miss Jane Smyth.</p>

																															<p>"We all think, dear," continued
																																Mrs. Naylor, "that for the sake of any
																																chivalrous ideas, quite worthy in
																																themselves, it is a considerable pity
																																for you to spoil your life. You are not
																																the sort of child who could stand
																																disgrace."</p>

																															<p>
																																"And you don't look the sort of child
																																who would under ordinary circumstances
																																act the idiot," said Miss Mackenzie
																																sharply. "As to the chivalrous nature of
																																your silence, I fail to see it. I hope
																																you have carefully considered the
																																position and are prepared to act openly
																																and honorably. By go doing you will save
																																the school and yourself. Now then, Ruth
																																Craven, will you come a little more
																																forward? Stand
																																<!-- Page 331 -->
																																<a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a>
																																just there.—Girls, you can all see Ruth
																																Craven, can you not?"
																															</p>

																															<p>The girls held up their hands in
																																token that they could.</p>

																															<p>"I will therefore at once proceed
																																to question her," continued Miss
																																Mackenzie.</p>

																															<p>There was just a moment's pause,
																																and during that complete silence a
																																dreadful rushing noise came into
																																Kathleen O'Hara's head. The floor for an
																																instant seemed to rise up as though it
																																would strike her; then she felt
																																composed, but very cold and white. She
																																fixed her eyes full on Ruth.</p>

																															<p>"I will hear her out. I must hear
																																the thing out," she kept saying to
																																herself. "Afterwards—afterwards—But I
																																must hear the whole thing out."</p>

																															<p>Miss Mackenzie turned, and in a
																																very emphatic voice began to question.</p>

																															<p>"You are prepared to reply to the
																																following questions?" she said.</p>

																															<p>Ruth's very steady eyes were
																																raised; she fixed them on Miss
																																Mackenzie. Her lips were firmly shut.
																																Nothing could be quieter than her
																																attitude; she did not show a trace of
																																emotion. Always pale, she looked a
																																little paler now than her wont. Her
																																darks eyes seemed to darken and grow
																																full of intense emotion; otherwise no
																																one could have told that she was
																																suffering or feeling anything in
																																particular.</p>

																															<p>"But I know what she is going
																																through," thought Kathleen. She clenched
																																her hands so tightly that the nails went
																																into the delicate flesh. She was glad of
																																the pain; it kept her from screaming
																																aloud.</p>

																															<p>"The first question I have to
																																ask," said Miss Mackenzie, "is this: How
																																many of the foundation girls have joined
																																the rebels?"</p>

																															<p>Ruth came a step nearer.</p>

																															<p>
																																<!-- Page 332 -->
																																<a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a>"How
																																many? I can't quite hear you."
																															</p>

																															<p>"I am sorry," said Ruth then, "but
																																I can't tell you."</p>

																															<p>Miss Mackenzie, without any show
																																of emotion, immediately entered Ruth's
																																answer in a little book which she held
																																in her hand.</p>

																															<p>"Oh, don't, Miss Mackenzie! Don't
																																be harsh," gasped little Mrs. Naylor.</p>

																															<p>Miss Mackenzie, as though she had
																																not heard the voice of her sister
																																governor, proceeded:</p>

																															<p>"What is the name of the founder
																																of the society?"</p>

																															<p>"I am not prepared to say,"
																																replied Ruth.</p>

																															<p>Again this answer was recorded.</p>

																															<p>"Can you give me an exact account
																																of the rules of the society, its
																																motives, its bearing generally?"</p>

																															<p>The same negative reply was the
																																result of this question.</p>

																															<p>"Do you know anything whatever of
																																the disgraceful escapade which took
																																place last night, when a certain number
																																of the members of this society went to
																																London and returned by themselves at
																																midnight?"</p>

																															<p>Ruth's face cleared a little at
																																this question.</p>

																															<p>"I cannot answer because I know
																																nothing," she said.</p>

																															<p>A slight look of relief was
																																visible on the faces of the unfortunate
																																girls who had gone to town with Kathleen
																																on the preceding night. A few more
																																questions were asked, Ruth replying on
																																every occasion in the negative. "I can't
																																say," or "I will not say," were the only
																																words that were wrung from her lips.</p>

																															<p>
																																"In short," said Miss Mackenzie very
																																quietly, "you have decided, Ruth
																																Craven—you, an ignorant, silly little
																																girl—to defy the governors of this
																																school. All justice has been dealt out
																																to you, and all patience. The
																																consequence of your mad action has been
																																explained to you with the utmost
																																fullness. You have been given
																																time—abundant time—to
																																<!-- Page 333 -->
																																<a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a>
																																consider. You have chosen, from what
																																false motives it is impossible to say—"
																															</p>

																															<p>"My dear," interrupted Mrs.
																																Naylor, "the child means well, I am
																																assured."</p>

																															<p>"From what false motives it is
																																impossible to say," continued Miss
																																Mackenzie, not taking the slightest
																																notice of the little governor's futile
																																appeal, "you have decided to wreck your
																																own life and to ruin the school. It was
																																to have been your noble privilege to
																																save the school in a time of extremity.
																																You have chosen the unworthy course. It
																																is therefore my painful duty to call
																																upon Miss Ravenscroft as head-mistress
																																to expel you, Ruth Craven, from this
																																school. You are no longer a member of
																																the Great Shirley School; you are—"</p>

																															<p>"Hold!" cried Kathleen.</p>

																															<p>Her voice rang out sharp and
																																clear. It was heard all over the school,
																																and was so imperative, so startling, so
																																unexpected, that even Miss Mackenzie
																																lost her self-control and fell back in
																																silence.</p>

																															<p>"Hold!" cried Kathleen again. "You
																																have said enough. I don't think you
																																ought to go on. You are torturing the
																																noblest girl in the world. But Kathleen
																																O'Hara, bad as she is, cannot endure
																																this last insult. Girls—Wild Irish
																																Girls, you who belong to my society—I as
																																your queen desire you to come forward.
																																Come forward in a body at once."</p>

																															<p>
																																What was there in the young voice that
																																impelled? What was there in the young
																																face that stimulated, that caused fear
																																to slink out of sight and courage to
																																come to the fore, that caused hearts to
																																beat high with generous emotion? Not a
																																single girl failed Kathleen in this
																																moment of her appeal. They clambered
																																over their seats; they bent under the
																																forms; they got out in any fashion,
																																until she was surrounded by the sixty
																																girls who formed her society. She
																																<!-- Page 334 -->
																																<a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a>
																																glanced round her; her dark-blue eyes
																																grew full of sweetness, and there was a
																																look on her face which made the girls
																																for the moment feel that they would die
																																for her.
																															</p>

																															<p>"Come, girls," said their
																																queen—"come; there is room on the
																																platform."</p>

																															<p>She sprang up the couple of steps
																																without another word, and the girls
																																followed her.</p>

																															<p>"Do what you like with Ruth
																																Craven, Miss Mackenzie," she cried; "but
																																put your questions over again to me, and
																																I will answer them one after the other.
																																Then expel me and my companions; turn us
																																out of the school, but keep the girl who
																																would be a credit to you."</p>

																																<h3>END OF THE GREAT REBELLION.</h3>


																																<p>No one quite knew what happened
																																	next. Some of the girls went off into
																																	violent hysterics; others rushed out of
																																	the great hall, half-fainting; while
																																	others controlled themselves and
																																	listened as best they could. The scene
																																	was vivid and picturesque. Mrs. Naylor
																																	sobbed quite audibly, and took hold of
																																	Ruth's hand, and even kissed it. But as
																																	she did so Kathleen herself came near
																																	and flung her arm round Ruth's neck.</p>

																																<p>
																																	"If you mean to expel Ruth you will
																																	expel me," she said. "But won't you
																																	forgive her? If her ideas were wrong,
																																	they were at least generous; and you
																																	know that I won't trouble you any more.
																																	I am very sorry, but I don't think that
																																	I was made to suit a great school like
																																	this, and I give up the society—yes,
																																	absolutely—so you won't have any rebels
																																	present in your midst again. Expel me,
																																	but keep her, for
																																	<!-- Page 335 -->
																																	<a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a>
																																	she will be the flower of your school,
																																	the greatest ornament, one you will
																																	talk of in the dim years of the future.
																																	Don't let me feel that I have spoilt
																																	her life."
																																</p>

																																<p>"But why did you act so, Kathleen
																																	O'Hara?" said Miss Mackenzie. "Why did
																																	you, a silly young girl, come over
																																	here, a stranger, to ruin the school
																																	and make us all unhappy?"</p>

																																<p>"I can't answer you that," said
																																	Kathleen, flinging out her hands. "I
																																	did what I was made to do. I am a rebel
																																	by nature. I believe I shall always be
																																	a rebel. I shall go home to father and
																																	mother and tell them I am not suited
																																	for a school like this. But don't expel
																																	Ruth, and don't expel the others."</p>

																																<p>"But we will all go if you are
																																	not kept," suddenly cried one of the
																																	sixty, Kathleen never quite knew which;
																																	and suddenly one girl after another
																																	began to speak up for her, and all
																																	promised that if Kathleen were allowed
																																	to remain, and if the whole story of
																																	the great rebellion was allowed to blow
																																	over, they would work as they had never
																																	done before. They wanted their queen to
																																	stay with them. Would the governors
																																	forgive their queen, just because she
																																	was an Irish girl and like no one else?</p>

																																<p>How it came to pass it was
																																	impossible to tell. There was something
																																	about Kathleen—the bold, bright, and
																																	yet generous look on her face, the love
																																	which darted out of her eyes when she
																																	grasped Ruth's hand—that even impressed
																																	Miss Mackenzie. She said after a pause
																																	that she was willing to reconsider
																																	matters, and that she and all the other
																																	governors would meet in a day or two to
																																	give their opinion.</p>

																																<p>
																																	Thus the school broke up. It had lived
																																	through its greatest and most exciting
																																	hour. But when Kathleen was seen going
																																	through the gates, her arm flung round
																																	Ruth's
																																	<!-- Page 336 -->
																																	<a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a>
																																	waist, and all the sixty girls
																																	following at her heels, such a cheer
																																	went up from the anxious mothers and
																																	fathers and brothers—for many fresh
																																	people had come to swell the crowd
																																	since Kathleen entered the school—as
																																	was never heard before in Merrifield.
																																</p>

																																<p>Thus ended the great rebellion.
																																	It is spoken of to this day as the
																																	greatest and most conspicuous event in
																																	the school's history. For, after all,
																																	the governors were lenient, and no girl
																																	was expelled. Kathleen, as years went
																																	on, became far and away the most
																																	popular girl in the school. Her talents
																																	were of the most brilliant order; her
																																	very faults seemed in one way to add to
																																	her charms. In one sense she was always
																																	a more or less troublesome girl; but
																																	where she loved she loved deeply, and
																																	from that hour she gave up all thought
																																	of rebellion either against the
																																	governors or against Miss Ravenscroft.
																																	Ruth was Kathleen's greatest friend.
																																	Her grandfather got better; his heart
																																	was never broken by the knowledge of
																																	that terrible disgrace which the child
																																	so feared that she would bring him.
																																	Mrs. Church became one of the Irish
																																	alms-women, and grumbled a good deal at
																																	the change in her position. Mrs.
																																	Hopkins's debt was cleared off; and all
																																	the characters in this story did well,
																																	and were proud to admit that they owed
																																	most of their future prosperity to the
																																	Wild Irish Girl, Kathleen O'Hara.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
