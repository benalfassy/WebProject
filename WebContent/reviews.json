[{"reviewId" : "243598","bookName" : "A Popular School Girl", "review" : "Four stars for the story, but Ingred deserves far less than that. As a main character I could never like her, and in fact found Bess to be the more interesting one. I wish she had stepped up sooner and gotten over her jealousy, she came across as a sulk for three quarters of the book! Still enjoyed the story though, so we'll go with four stars for this one.", "reviewerUsername" : "ben", "isApproved" : "2", "date" : "2018-02-13"},
